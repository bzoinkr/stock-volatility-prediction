What's bad: Paypal is integrated into over 30 million websites compared to \\~2.5 million for Apple Pay and under 1 million for the Google Pay button. However, Apple and Google Pay are showing massive growth, and if the trend continues, they will gradually eat into PayPal's market share. On top of that PayPal plays virtually no role in Asia, which is dominated by Alipay and WeChat, and there are no signs that PayPal will be able to gain market share here so no growth to be expected in \"emerging markets\". From a market share perspective, the outlook is bad and this is where most of the negative sentiment is coming from.

However, Klarna and other new payment providers first have to be integrated by merchants, while PayPal is already active on 30 million sites, which is a massive competitive advantage over new providers.

This boom in AI demand is very much in the spotlight by the market, especially with the S&P inclusion. Now the company is trading at about 2.5-3x their normal multiples.

If data center projects evaporate, margins will compress and earnings growth may actually go negative. In that case, getting back to $1,338 may take more like 12-15 years.

Figured I’d post the risk map because the bull and bear takes I keep seeing here miss the same thing. People argue HIMS like it’s one company. It’s two. Business A is the cash pay subscription platform: hair, ED, derm, mental health. Recurring revenue, no insurance friction. That engine is real and I’m not here to dunk on it. Business B was the GLP1 compounding era. A national funnel built around a regulatory perimeter that was never meant for mass market distribution.

From what’s been publicly reported: non GLP ARPU went from roughly $60 to $55 in a single quarter, Q2 2025. Blended ARPU fell from roughly $84 to $74 over the same window. Marketing was about $218M in Q2 2025 against roughly 73,000 net new subs, which is about $3,000 per marginal add. Gross margin went from roughly 82% in FY2023 to roughly 74% by Q3 2025. Mix and fulfillment complexity doing what they always do to high margin platform narratives. None of that means the company’s dead.

It just means outcomes get more binary. When it works, it’s fast. When it doesn’t, there’s no one to pull the brake. You’re underwriting one person’s judgment whether you want to or not.

Patient specific compounding in narrow lawful use cases is a completely different universe from a nationwide, ad driven, subscription checkout GLP1 funnel.

Translation: they may keep offering weight loss solutions. The risky part is the national funnel built on a regulatory edge. Okay. The math people keep dodging: the 2030 converts. About $1B in zero coupon convertible notes due May 2030. Conversion price $70.67. Stock’s around $16. Those notes behave like cash debt, not equity dilution. Base case: they’ve reported about $1.1B cash and roughly $300M a year free cash flow. Four years of that is about $1.2B. Add the cash and you’re around $2.3B of firepower against $1B due. That can work. Downside case, the one that actually matters: if GLP1 unwinds fast and free cash flow drops to $100M to $150M a year, four years gives you $400M to $600M. Starting cash $1.1B plus that generation equals $1.5B to $1.7B. Pay the notes and you’re left with $0.5B to $0.7B for everything. Ops, marketing, legal drain. Not bankruptcy. But it turns into a refinancing and capital allocation story that gets louder every quarter the GLP1 line deteriorates. The notes don’t care what you call the pivot. They care whether the cash shows up. Where I land: neutral. HIMS can survive if the GLP1 transition happens in an orderly way and subscriber economics stabilize. If revenue drops faster than management can replace it while legal pressure escalates, this flips from a growth story to a balance sheet story before 2030. What would change my mind: GLP1 exposure declining without a cliff, non GLP unit economics stabilizing, and legal and regulatory outcomes staying bounded. If you want my quick framing: best case, the GLP1 line shrinks gracefully or transitions to compliant alternatives and the core keeps printing. Middle case, the core lives but growth slows and it trades like a prove it story. Worst case, you get an abrupt operational hit, CAC rises, margins compress, and the 2030 notes become the overhang everyone pretends not to see. Next things I’m watching are guidance on earnings, any legal or regulatory move that forces immediate operational changes, and unit economics trend ex GLP. One question for bulls: if you strip out GLP1 entirely, what’s your steady state CAC for the core platform after a year of negative headlines?

They are at their maximum bond-holding capacity relative to cash positions. If the regulation is eased or treasuries are exempt from the calculation, magically more bonds can be bought. *4.

Treasury Buybacks* The U.S. Treasury recently launched a formal buyback program TGA account funds are used to buy back old and unwanted bonds, and then new bonds are issued. This lower yields and also gives Market Makers the liquidity to buy future bonds and stabilise Treasury auctions. *3. Regulatory Relief* Right now banks are capped on the amount of bonds vs cash they can hold on the books due to leverage ratio regulation. They are at their maximum bond-holding capacity relative to cash positions. If the regulation is eased or treasuries are exempt from the calculation, magically more bonds can be bought. *4. Long Haul Financial Repression* Forcing institutions to hold government debt at artificially low rates. The buyback is already in place as evidenced in the past quarter. The SRF is likely to also be moved into motion in the short term as a crisis aversion method. And financial repression is almost inevitable over the longer term **All these liquidity intervention strategies are inflationary and point to a structurally weaker USD over time.** **🍀**", "score": 14, "num_comments": 23, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1r3sjul/usd_weakness_liquidity_strain_march_q1_treasuries/", "post_url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1r3sjul/usd_weakness_liquidity_strain_march_q1_treasuries/"}

I was even more devastated, I didn't have to wait one the market as a whole to recover, I had to hope a single the company did as well. Worse, because I'm European, the S&P Global stock was in euro's (MHL.DE), so when SPGI recovered around August, I was still 10% down because the Dollar dropped as well. I swore to myself I would become a better investor in the future. I spent hours and hours researching stuff and regretting I didn't do it before. But I learned everything about ETFs, DCA, that stock picking was risky, ... Around September I started putting 500 euro monthly in an all world ETF. In October when SPGI dropped a bit, a also put in 8k more, to make the recovery faster. I also knew what to do in the future with SPGI, put a stop loss to be safe, even if I sell for a small loss, it's much better than keeping the risk of all that money in one company and with Trump. And no panic sell if it should go down a bit again. Fast forward to about a month ago, SPGI made a pretty good recovery, I was almost free, it only needed 5% more, I was so happy.

I became so hyper focused on that because the outlooks where all positive, that I didn't even think about any negative way it could go, and I completely forgor about the stop loss. I'm sure you all saw the news the last couple of weeks. First the new Anthropic model that shook the financial stocks, it went down by -16%. But no worries, the earnings were around the corner. Everyone was saying the rebound was going to happen, such a great company with an amazing track record. Not a single thought reminded me that I never set a stop loss.

Now the question is, do I keep it for who knows how long until it recovers (by break even in USD is 550, pretty much their ATH), or do I bite the bullet and sell everything because who knows how lower it can go (that would be about 10k loss total). The shame I feel is even worse than the financial loss. For information, I currently have 70k saved, 15k in ETFs and the 18k at -30% (and counting) on SPGI. I would appreciate any help.

My life savings are riding on managing my wealth and this moment correctly and I think I'm on to something here. I recently re-wrote my portfolio allocation plan and I want to explain my reasoning and hopefully have a discussion about what you agree with and what you disagree with and we can all learn in the process. My core thesis is that AI will in fact advance rapidly. My understanding of the underlying technology supports this, and the top researchers and industry leaders are betting big on it as well. That is the core of this portfolio. My expectation is that AI capabilities will match and exceed humans across a broad domain of economically valuable tasks beginning in 2026. This is supported by the METR benchmark, the GDPval benchmark, the observed trajectory of AI research (memory, continual learning, agent swarms) and infrastructure buildout as leading indicators. The wave began with Nvidia's rise, and will expand to the cloud providers as capabilities prove themselves in the coming 0-5 years. Now let's break each segment down. \\--- **Technology** Explained above, this is the core. Key positions are **Nvidia**, which commands the global supply chain for GPUs, the fundamental unit for fueling AI's training *and* inference. This is a highly fungible asset. It can be used to build better models, improve recommendation systems, generate video, audio, proteins, etc. I believe there will always be a high-value use for this. I believe the depreciation concerns are overblown. A100s are being rented out for 95% of their original contract price and those chips are nearly 6 years old. Memory is fundamental to AI accelerators. They're the single largest cost in the bill-of-materials for GPUs and will continue to be necessary regardless of ASICs gaining market share. The new base of consumption for memory is expanding as fast as hyperscaler capex, and the ability for the supply to expand is constrained by complex manufacturing processes like advanced packaging. This means that this time HBM memory suppliers will be slower to catch up to demand than in previous cycles. Cloud is in a strong position because all inference demand funnels here. AI startups may disrupt established enterprises, or the enterprises may win. **I don't know, and no one does.** By betting on this layer of the stack you avoid this risk of disruption and wild narrative and sentiment swings. **Alphabet** stands out as the leader here. They have TPUs, Google Cloud, Gemini, and a distribution base of apps with billions of daily users. Software is a bet on AI beneficiaries. These are companies with large established platforms and user bases that would be difficult to steal. They have all proven to be durable against competition and highly adaptive. They share in having access to very valuable proprietary data that can be a unique competitive advantage against AI native competitors. **Healthcare** **Eli Lilly** is my champion here. I believe the oral GLP-1 that is pending approval will be a truly revolutionary product. It can be produced cheaply and sold at a high margin. It addresses a massive market: obesity and diabetes. It has also been found to improve other conditions such as heart health, Alzheimer's, kidney health, sleep apnea, and inflammation related pains. They also have a significant partnership with Isomorphic Labs from Google, helping them advance AI-led drug discoveries at scale. **Energy** Energy is the primary physical constraint. I'm treating these as a basket that represents power generation across sources, grid, and transmission infrastructure companies. My thesis includes the high probability of data center power demand exceeding available supply around the 2028 time horizon.

My life savings are riding on managing my wealth and this moment correctly and I think I'm on to something here. I recently re-wrote my portfolio allocation plan and I want to explain my reasoning and hopefully have a discussion about what you agree with and what you disagree with and we can all learn in the process. My core thesis is that AI will in fact advance rapidly. My understanding of the underlying technology supports this, and the top researchers and industry leaders are betting big on it as well. That is the core of this portfolio. My expectation is that AI capabilities will match and exceed humans across a broad domain of economically valuable tasks beginning in 2026. This is supported by the METR benchmark, the GDPval benchmark, the observed trajectory of AI research (memory, continual learning, agent swarms) and infrastructure buildout as leading indicators. The wave began with Nvidia's rise, and will expand to the cloud providers as capabilities prove themselves in the coming 0-5 years. Now let's break each segment down. \\--- **Technology** Explained above, this is the core. Key positions are **Nvidia**, which commands the global supply chain for GPUs, the fundamental unit for fueling AI's training *and* inference. This is a highly fungible asset. It can be used to build better models, improve recommendation systems, generate video, audio, proteins, etc. I believe there will always be a high-value use for this. I believe the depreciation concerns are overblown. A100s are being rented out for 95% of their original contract price and those chips are nearly 6 years old. Memory is fundamental to AI accelerators. They're the single largest cost in the bill-of-materials for GPUs and will continue to be necessary regardless of ASICs gaining market share. The new base of consumption for memory is expanding as fast as hyperscaler capex, and the ability for the supply to expand is constrained by complex manufacturing processes like advanced packaging. This means that this time HBM memory suppliers will be slower to catch up to demand than in previous cycles. Cloud is in a strong position because all inference demand funnels here. AI startups may disrupt established enterprises, or the enterprises may win. **I don't know, and no one does.** By betting on this layer of the stack you avoid this risk of disruption and wild narrative and sentiment swings. **Alphabet** stands out as the leader here. They have TPUs, Google Cloud, Gemini, and a distribution base of apps with billions of daily users. Software is a bet on AI beneficiaries. These are companies with large established platforms and user bases that would be difficult to steal. They have all proven to be durable against competition and highly adaptive. They share in having access to very valuable proprietary data that can be a unique competitive advantage against AI native competitors. **Healthcare** **Eli Lilly** is my champion here. I believe the oral GLP-1 that is pending approval will be a truly revolutionary product. It can be produced cheaply and sold at a high margin. It addresses a massive market: obesity and diabetes. It has also been found to improve other conditions such as heart health, Alzheimer's, kidney health, sleep apnea, and inflammation related pains. They also have a significant partnership with Isomorphic Labs from Google, helping them advance AI-led drug discoveries at scale. **Energy** Energy is the primary physical constraint. I'm treating these as a basket that represents power generation across sources, grid, and transmission infrastructure companies. My thesis includes the high probability of data center power demand exceeding available supply around the 2028 time horizon. This will make access to energy the critical bottleneck for further expansion of AI capacity in the US. I expect these companies to be highly durable and accelerate growth over the coming decade. This power constraint should also improve the pricing power of cloud providers with connected active power. **Financial** Berkshire Hathaway is the volatility ballast and quasi-cash reserve. Mastercard is making headway in their services business to monetize data and agentic commerce. Agentic commerce has the potential to go parabolic in the coming 1-2 years and MA owns the rails.

Market Cap: €4.25 Billion ($4.6B). This is a regulated Mid/Large Cap, not a penny stock. **1. The Business Model: A Structural Monopoly** FDJ holds a long-term legal monopoly on lottery games and offline sports betting in France. Unlike US-based operators like DraftKings or Penn that burn cash on customer acquisition, FDJ leverages a physical network of 30,000+ points of sale. This serves as a massive, low-cost funnel for their high-margin digital platforms. * Expansion: With the recent acquisition of Kindred Group (Unibet), FDJ has become the #2 gambling operator in Europe. * Modernization: This deal shifted digital revenue from 12% to over 30% of total group revenue. * Profitability: The group maintains a recurring EBITDA margin of ~24%, while its core lottery business reaches 35%. **2. The Dividend Thesis (9.3% Yield)** For income-oriented investors, the primary draw is the current valuation vs. the dividend policy. * Yield: At the current price (~€22.60), the expected ~€2.10 dividend provides a 9.3% yield. * Payout Ratio: Management is committed to a 75% payout, which is sustainable given their strong Free Cash Flow (FCF) generation. * Dividend Progression: * 2020: €0.45 | 2021: €0.90€ | 2022: €1.24 | 2023: €1.37 | 2024: €1.78 | 2025: €2.05 * 2026 Estimate: €2,05-2,10 **3. Why the Discount? (Risks vs. Reality)** The stock has been pressured by two main factors: * Leverage: Debt taken for the €2.5B Kindred acquisition. * Regulation: A recent tax hike on gambling in France. While these are valid concerns, FDJ is a \"deleveraging machine.\" Their predictable cash flows allow for rapid debt reduction, a strategy management has already prioritized through 2026. **4. Technical Setup & Sentiment** Sentiment is currently very bearish, with Short Interest at 5.89%. However, the liquidity profile is extremely tight: 40% of the capital is locked by the French State and long-term partners. With 10.9M shares shorted and low daily volume, the Days to Cover is approximately 21 days. Any positive fundamental shift could lead to a sharp technical recovery as shorts compete for a narrow exit. **5. Upcoming Catalyst: February 19th Earnings** The annual results next week will be the major catalyst for 2026: * Dividend Confirmation: Formally announcing the payout will likely trigger buying from institutional value funds. * Debt Update: Any guidance on the speed of deleveraging post-Kindred will be the key metric to watch. **Conclusion** I see $FDJU as a classic \"mispriced\" defensive asset. You are buying a government-backed monopoly at a 9.3% yield with an expanding European footprint.

What's interesting is that while everyone focused on the Nvidia carnage, Chinese tech stocks have been on a tear that most Western investors seem to be ignoring. The numbers are pretty striking. Chinese stocks added roughly $1.3 trillion in market cap following the DeepSeek announcement. The Hang Seng Tech Index is up 23% in 2025. But here's what really caught my attention - Cambricon Technologies, the domestic AI chip company that makes chips DeepSeek's models can actually run on, just reported revenue up 44x year over year and swung from a 533 million yuan loss to over 1 billion yuan in profit in the first half of 2025. The stock roughly doubled over the past twelve months (from \\~CNY 520 to \\~CNY 1,037 as of early February), though it peaked at CNY 1,596 in August 2025 before correcting sharply. If you zoom out to two years, the gain is closer to 10x from its 2024 lows. Worth noting the stock just crashed 13% in a single day on Feb 3 after social media rumors about weak 2026 revenue guidance - the company denied it, but it lost over CNY 77 billion in market cap in three trading days. Volatility in this name is extreme. The thesis here is that DeepSeek's V3 model natively supports domestic chips including Huawei Ascend, Cambricon, and Hygon. This is significant because it means the entire AI inference stack can now run on Chinese hardware. ByteDance and Tencent are reportedly testing Baidu Kunlun and Cambricon chips as alternatives. What makes this more interesting is the rumor mill around DeepSeek's next model. Reports suggest R2 was originally planned for mid-2025 but got delayed because founder Liang Wenfeng wasn't satisfied with performance. The delay was partly due to difficulties training on Huawei's Ascend chips, which is kind of ironic given the whole point was to reduce dependence on Nvidia. But just this week DeepSeek published a new paper on a training method called \"Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections\" that analysts are calling a breakthrough for scaling larger models. Some think this could form the backbone of their V4 model. DeepSeek has a pattern of dropping papers right before major releases. There's also talk of a next-gen AI agent that could launch in Q1 2026, apparently capable of executing multi-step tasks autonomously. If they pull off another DeepSeek moment with a new model, it could trigger another leg up in these names. The challenge for US investors is that pure-play exposure to this theme is limited. KWEB is mostly internet stocks with zero A-share exposure. CQQQ has some onshore names but only about 34% A-share weight due to inclusion factor caps. The real action in names like Cambricon is happening in the A-share market where most US investors can't easily access. I recently came across CNQQ which has about 50% A-share weight and actually holds Cambricon, CATL, and other hard-tech names that the internet-focused funds miss entirely.

Initially there was significant concern raised regarding irrational spending plans, higher debt loads, and reduced short to medium term GDP and national revenue. As I believe the markets are also suspecting, Takaichi will pivot to more sound fiscal strategies in line with Gov Ueda (BOJ) and MoF advice. Recent statements from PM Takaichi are supportive of this shift. Thought so. \\* *Chinese De-risking & Cascade Risk*: Chinese regulators have advised domestic financial institutions to reduce exposure to U.S. Treasuries to mitigate concentration risk per Bloomberg, February 9. BRICS nations may take significant note of this posturing and derisking. \\* *Yield Convergence*: Japanese Government Bond yields have reached multi-decade highs, with the 10-year yield at 2.28% and the 30-year at 3.65%. This tightening yield spread is approaching pain territory. \\* *Employment Expectations*: National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett has begun to manage expectations ahead of the Jan Non-Farm Payrolls report, which is forecast at approx. 70k jobs. This media appearance had me intrigued. **The Hassett Productivity-led Expansion Thesis & Critique:** In what appears effectively to be damage control, a televised interview on CNBC, Feb 9 had Kevin Hassett arguing that a sequence of lower employment figures is consistent with GDP growth due to exponential efficiency gains from AI. Further and more unsound in argument, Kevin Kassett stated that the equilibrium employment rate to maintain low unemployment is now lower due to population decline and the deportation of undocumented immigrants. This logic is a facetious conflation of supply efficiency with aggregate demand stability. While AI & tech adoption may increase output per worker, the absence of wage growth or labor demand creates a long-term consumption-inventory mismatch, or glut. Additionally, a contracting labor pool directly reduces the total addressable market of the domestic economy. And to consider international audiences as the desired markets would be at odds with the US position as a net importer. Ultimately fewer participants in the labor market reduces aggregate demand, which is inherently recessionary regardless of productivity gains. The purported productivity gains hypothesis is essentially framing labor market weakness as technological evolution to mask likely resulting future demand contraction. **The road ahead & forks present:** USD, DXY, YEN currently seesawing in no-man's land. Markets likewise. Upcoming events I'm monitoring: Feb 11 NFP. Feb 13 US CPI. Feb 20 US Supreme Court IEEPA. Mar 18 FED rate. Mar 19 BOJ & Trump/Takaichi Summit. **Immediate Post-NFP Avenues/Reactions:** A. A Jobs Surprise OR Accepting the NEC Hypothesis: The market accepts the \\*new\\* equilibrium employment rate thesis, interest rates are held, USD and DXY remain steady, markets remain sideways to upward. A positive surprise may give markets a second wind. Having said that, media appearances by the NEC director frontrunning an important NFP report to calm markets may be a warning signal worth heeding. B. Consumption Contraction: If the employment report confirms a genuine labor market shrink, the productivity argument may lose steam due to aforementioned logical counterarguments. As personal savings sit at a multi-year low of 3.5%, a March rate cut will be increasingly more probable with demand predicted to stangate or reduce. The bigger the job losses the greater the risk of outcomes aligning with research from the Federal Reserve Board, showing that L-shaped recessions may have increasing difficulty returning to pre-recessionary status. A productivity increase as explanation for job reductions only solidifies the reduced likelihood of a jobs rebound. I see increased probability here. Central banks forecast this outcome at circa \\~35%. C. Systemic Liquidation: Should Chinese Treasury divestment accelerate, US yields will likely spike, and resulting instability may trigger breakdown of the 155 USDYEN support, and compress stock multiples. USD bearish, YEN bullish. Not the most likely, however not off the table whatsoever. **The Outlook**: The focus on a lower replacement threshold ignores the reality that high productivity is a liability if the consumer base is obliterated by permanent job losses and household liquidity depletion.

Silver downgrade kills pricing power. Bear case + puts thesis", "selftext": "Pandora’s recent decision to pivot away from sterling silver and toward platinum-plated jewellery (over their proprietary “Ever-shine” base alloy) is being framed as a smart response to the surge in silver prices. In reality, I think it is one of the worst strategic decisions I have seen from a mass-market luxury-adjacent consumer brand in years. This is not margin optimisation. This is Pandora fundamentally misunderstanding what business it is in, massively overestimating its brand power, and walking directly into a smaller, uglier, structurally inferior market. If I was a shareholder, I would actively campaign against this decision. **1) This decision screams CEO misread (wrong playbook, wrong industry)** Pandora’s new CEO, **Berta de Pablos-Barbier**, has a background that makes this decision make perfect sense to her, while being disastrous for Pandora: * President and CEO of LVMH’s champagne brands (Moët & Chandon, Dom Pérignon, Mercier) * CMO of Lacoste * Senior roles at Boucheron This is a person trained in the world of brand-first luxury, where the product itself is secondary to image, story, and logo. That logic works for champagne (where brand is the product), fashion houses (where the logo is the asset), and high jewellery (where heritage and design allow huge premiums over metal value). Pandora is not in those categories. Pandora is mass-market entry-level luxury jewellery. Their customers are not paying for a 200-year history. They are paying for an accessible version of real jewellery. The problem is that this decision reflects an executive worldview shaped by industries where you can detach the product from the underlying materials and still charge premium prices. Pandora cannot do that. Pandora is not a fashion brand that happens to sell jewellery. Pandora is a jewellery company with a brand premium. And that distinction is everything. **2) Pandora is a jewellery company first, and a brand second** People keep discussing Pandora as if it is a fashion-style brand business where the logo is the product and the underlying materials are irrelevant. It is not. Pandora is, first and foremost, a jewellery company. The brand matters, but it is an overlay on top of the product, not a substitute for it. Pandora’s pricing power exists because customers believe they are buying: * real jewellery (sterling silver) * branded jewellery (so it has trust and resale value) * sentimental jewellery (giftable, symbolic, personal) Pandora is not competing purely on design, scarcity, or craftsmanship. They are competing on the idea that you can buy something real, durable, and valuable without paying Tiffany prices. That is why Pandora can charge significantly more than Chinese and Indian OEM jewellery and unbranded charm products. Their customers might not understand metal markets, but they absolutely understand the difference between: * sterling silver * plated alloy Even if they cannot articulate it, they feel it instinctively. **3) Sterling silver gives Pandora a resale floor that plating destroys** Sterling silver is currently around **$2.40 per gram**. That means Pandora jewellery has something costume jewellery does not. It has an embedded commodity floor value. Even if the jewellery is scratched, damaged, or destroyed, the owner can still scrap it. That matters psychologically even if most customers never actually do it. And beyond melt value, Pandora pieces often resell above scrap because the brand adds a premium. This is why Pandora works so well as a gift product. It feels like a real asset. Now compare that to plated alloy. Platinum plating sounds luxurious, but in reality the amount of platinum used is microscopic. It is essentially dusting the surface. Even if Pandora’s Ever-shine alloy is decent, the scrap value of the metal content in a small charm is basically nothing. You are not going to take a plated charm to a jeweller and get meaningful money for it. If sterling silver is roughly $2.40 per gram, the metal value of a plated charm is closer to something like **$0.01 to $0.06 per gram**, depending on the alloy, plating thickness, and composition. Pandora’s alloy is proprietary so we cannot know exactly, but the point is obvious. From the customer’s perspective, the intrinsic value of plated alloy jewellery is effectively **zero**. So Pandora is destroying the “worst case” floor that has supported its pricing power for decades. Pandora’s management seems to think customers will not notice because the jewellery still looks shiny and premium. They will notice. Because the next step is predictable. The deeper issue is what this decision signals to the market. If Pandora has to strip out sterling silver to protect margins, it is effectively admitting that their historical profitability depended on selling precious metal at a premium. In other words, their pricing power may have been weaker than investors assumed. A company with true brand-led pricing power would pass higher input costs through to consumers. A company forced to downgrade materials is signalling that it cannot. **4) Pandora is making the worst possible product for plating: daily-wear jewellery** Plated jewellery can work in costume jewellery because most costume jewellery is worn occasionally. It is statement pieces worn to events, nights out, or parties, often larger necklaces, cuffs, and bangles. Those items do not see heavy daily wear. Pandora’s core products are the exact opposite: * charm bracelets * rings * stackable pieces * things people wear every day I personally know multiple people who wear their Pandora charm bracelet daily without taking it off. Daily wear is brutal. Constant friction, sweat, soap, perfume exposure, banging against surfaces, repeated abrasion on bracelet links and charm holes. Plating will wear off. Once it wears off, you get tarnish, discolouration, skin staining, and turning green complaints. And it does not matter how much Pandora insists their alloy is premium or proprietary. All it takes is one widely-shared meme: **Pandora turns green now.** And the brand is permanently damaged. Pandora is voluntarily walking into a predictable consumer backlash cycle that has destroyed countless mid-market jewellery brands. **5) This move forces Pandora into costume jewellery whether they admit it or not** If you remove sterling silver as the core material, Pandora becomes costume jewellery. This is not an opinion. It is literally a category shift. They can call it innovation or sustainability or new materials, but the consumer translation is simple: **Pandora is plated jewellery now.** And that is the exact positioning Pandora spent decades avoiding. Pandora’s customers did not choose Pandora because they wanted fashion accessories. They chose Pandora because it felt like the cheapest way to buy real jewellery with status attached. That is what is being destroyed. **6) The costume jewellery market is smaller, uglier, and structurally terrible** People do not understand how important market structure is here. The global costume jewellery market is valued around **$31 to $45 billion (2023 to 2024).** Now compare that to fine jewellery: * broader global jewellery market is estimated **$350 to $380 billion in 2025** * projected to exceed **$500 billion by 2033** * luxury jewellery segment specifically is **$49 to $66 billion (2024)**, with strong growth driven by Asia-Pacific demand So Pandora is pivoting away from a category adjacent to a hundreds-of-billions global market, and pushing itself into a far smaller, more commoditised, brutally competitive market. This is not a smart pivot. This is moving into a segment with worse economics. Costume jewellery is dominated by two kinds of players. First, fashion houses like Dior, Gucci, Chanel, and so on. They derive pricing power from clothing prestige. The jewellery is just an extension of the logo. Pandora does not have that type of prestige. Second, low-cost fast fashion and OEM supply chains. This is where the real competition is. Chinese and Indian manufacturers producing plated jewellery at absurdly low cost. Once Pandora becomes plated jewellery, it is forced into competition with an industrial machine that will undercut it forever. That is a race to the bottom. **7) History already shows what happens: the mid-tier costume giants collapsed** The best evidence that this market is terrible is that the old dominant names in costume jewellery are either dead or irrelevant. The mid-century American giants include Coro, Trifari, Monet, and Napier. These brands were huge. They had scale, recognition, and distribution. And the market still wiped them out. Some exist as trademarks, but the industrial powerhouses are gone. This is what happens when you sell non-precious jewellery at a premium without the fashion-house prestige moat. Pandora is voluntarily placing itself on the same path. **8) Swarovski exists, but Swarovski’s success proves the opposite of what Pandora thinks** If Pandora wants to play in premium costume jewellery, the obvious comparable is Swarovski. And to be clear, Swarovski is not collapsing. Their jewellery business is actually performing well. Swarovski’s Crystal Business generated **€1.906 billion in revenue in FY2024**, with 6 percent organic growth, jewellery sales growing 9 percent organically, lab-grown diamond sales more than doubling, and the company returning to profitability. So the lesson is not that Swarovski is failing. The lesson is why Swarovski is succeeding. Swarovski’s pricing power comes from something Pandora does not have. A genuine product identity. Swarovski is not generic costume jewellery. Swarovski is crystals. It has a materials story, a visual signature, and an instantly recognisable aesthetic that competitors cannot replicate without being obvious copies. Pandora has no equivalent. And Swarovski’s strategy is built around bold, colourful, extravagant statement design. Their LUXignite strategy positions Swarovski as “pop luxury” built on visual spectacle, plus a credible move into lab-grown diamonds. Pandora cannot replicate that. Pandora’s brand identity is fundamentally understated and sentimental. Its hero products are charm bracelets and stackable everyday pieces. If Swarovski’s identity is spectacle, Pandora’s identity is safe, wearable, and personal. So when Pandora shifts away from sterling silver into plated alloy, it does not read as reinvention. It reads as cost cutting. It reads as downgrade. That is the key difference. Swarovski’s customer experiences an upgrade in design and identity. Pandora’s customer experiences a reduction in material value. And in jewellery, that distinction is fatal. **9) The other comps do not work: Alexis Bittar and Kenneth Jay Lane are not Pandora** Other premium costume jewellery brands include Alexis Bittar and Kenneth Jay Lane. But these brands are design-led and niche. They are aimed at an older, more fashion-forward demographic and built around statement aesthetics. Pandora is the opposite. Mass-market, sentimental gift-driven, everyday wear, repetitive charm concept. Pandora cannot reposition into that design niche without losing its existing customer base. So Pandora is entering a market where it does not have fashion-house prestige, it does not have Swarovski’s crystal identity, and it does not have design-cult uniqueness. Which means it has no moat. **10) Once Pandora’s perceived quality collapses, pricing power is gone forever** Pandora’s current positioning is a very delicate sweet spot. It is above cheap high street jewellery, below fine luxury houses, real enough to justify the spend, accessible enough to be mass-market. That is why Pandora works. But if consumers start associating Pandora with tarnish, plating wear, green skin, and cheap alloy, Pandora loses its premium perception. Once that happens, the market forces Pandora down. They will be forced to cut prices to compete with Thomas Sabo, Lovisa, cheap Amazon brands, Shein-tier jewellery, and Chinese and Indian OEM supply. At that point, Pandora becomes a commodity retailer with a fading logo. And it will never regain its old pricing power. Brand perception moves down quickly and moves up extremely slowly. **11) Competitors will eat them once the brand is weakened** If Pandora loses its sterling silver anchor, competitors will take their market share. There are already strong alternatives: * Thomas Sabo * Lovisa * Trollbeads * Chamilia (owned by Swarovski, which is telling) * general fashion jewellery substitutes Pandora is basically handing them a free opportunity. Especially Chamilia, which already competes in the charm segment with Swarovski backing and costume jewellery expertise. **12) Moving down-market also blocks moving up-market** Once Pandora damages its brand perception, it traps itself. If it tries to go down-market, it faces OEM competition. If it tries to go up-market later, it faces Trollbeads (higher quality, rarer, less mass-market), Tiffany and Co, David Yurman, and real fine jewellery brands. Pandora copied Trollbeads’ entire concept originally, but Trollbeads has scarcity and craftsmanship Pandora cannot replicate at scale. Pandora has no easy upward path once it abandons its real metal identity. **13) Collabs are at risk: Disney is not guaranteed forever** Pandora has relied heavily on collaborations. Disney (major), Bridgerton (recent), and other branded tie-ins. If Pandora’s perceived quality collapses, those partner brands may reassess whether they want their IP associated with cheap plated jewellery. Disney already sells down-market costume jewellery. Pandora was attractive because it was above that tier. If Pandora becomes indistinguishable from lower market costume products, Disney can demand better terms, reduce partnership intensity, or walk entirely. Losing Disney would be catastrophic because Disney products are a meaningful share of Pandora’s demand engine. **14) The core problem: Pandora cannot detach itself from materials like true luxury can** In high jewellery, brands can charge massive premiums over metal value because they have centuries of heritage, design leadership, cultural prestige, craftsmanship narratives, and scarcity. Pandora has none of those moats. Pandora’s moat is scale, distribution, and real metal at accessible prices. If Pandora removes the real metal component, they are betting that their logo alone can support premium pricing. That is a luxury fashion assumption. And it is wrong. Even in luxury jewellery and fashion, materials still matter. Construction quality still matters. People still care about what they are actually buying. In high jewellery, materials matter even more than brand in the vast majority of cases. A Cartier necklace still needs to be gold. A Van Cleef piece still needs to be constructed properly. A Boucheron client still cares about stone quality. Pandora seems to be forgetting that jewellery is not champagne. Jewellery is not a t-shirt. Jewellery is not perfume. You cannot strip out the material value and expect the brand to survive unchanged. **Conclusion: This is not margin management, it is a value-destructive decision** Pandora switching from sterling silver to platinum-plated alloy is like a premium denim brand switching from real denim to polyester to protect margins. The spreadsheet looks better short term. The brand is structurally impaired long term. Pandora is not moving into a new innovative category. They are voluntarily stepping down into costume jewellery, a market that is smaller ($31 to $45B), brutally commoditised, structurally dominated by fashion houses and OEM mass production, and historically a graveyard for mid-tier premium brands. And they are doing it with the worst possible product format (daily-wear charm bracelets and rings), guaranteeing that plating failure becomes a consumer meme. Once the meme exists, Pandora’s pricing power collapses. Once pricing power collapses, Pandora is forced down-market. Once Pandora is down-market, it is fighting Shein and OEM factories. And that is not a business model. That is slow liquidation disguised as strategy. If shareholders are rational, they should fight this decision aggressively before Pandora permanently destroys the one thing that made the company valuable. Its position as the world’s default real jewellery for normal people. This is irreversible brand damage. **TL;DR:** Pandora switching from sterling silver to platinum-plated alloy is not a harmless cost-saving move. It is a structural downgrade that destroys the material value floor and “real jewellery” perception that underpins their pricing power. Because Pandora is daily-wear jewellery (bracelets, rings), plating wear and tarnish complaints will explode, damaging brand equity and forcing them down-market into a commoditised costume jewellery segment where they will be crushed by OEM imports and cheaper competitors. Swarovski works because it has a distinct crystal identity and reinvention narrative. Pandora’s move reads as cost-cutting and downgrade, not reinvention. If I were a shareholder, I would actively campaign against this decision. **(P.S. Sorry for the long post.)**", "text": "Pandora (CPH:PNDORA) going plated is brand destruction.

And in jewellery, that distinction is fatal. **9) The other comps do not work: Alexis Bittar and Kenneth Jay Lane are not Pandora** Other premium costume jewellery brands include Alexis Bittar and Kenneth Jay Lane. But these brands are design-led and niche. They are aimed at an older, more fashion-forward demographic and built around statement aesthetics. Pandora is the opposite. Mass-market, sentimental gift-driven, everyday wear, repetitive charm concept. Pandora cannot reposition into that design niche without losing its existing customer base. So Pandora is entering a market where it does not have fashion-house prestige, it does not have Swarovski’s crystal identity, and it does not have design-cult uniqueness. Which means it has no moat. **10) Once Pandora’s perceived quality collapses, pricing power is gone forever** Pandora’s current positioning is a very delicate sweet spot. It is above cheap high street jewellery, below fine luxury houses, real enough to justify the spend, accessible enough to be mass-market. That is why Pandora works. But if consumers start associating Pandora with tarnish, plating wear, green skin, and cheap alloy, Pandora loses its premium perception. Once that happens, the market forces Pandora down. They will be forced to cut prices to compete with Thomas Sabo, Lovisa, cheap Amazon brands, Shein-tier jewellery, and Chinese and Indian OEM supply. At that point, Pandora becomes a commodity retailer with a fading logo. And it will never regain its old pricing power. Brand perception moves down quickly and moves up extremely slowly. **11) Competitors will eat them once the brand is weakened** If Pandora loses its sterling silver anchor, competitors will take their market share. There are already strong alternatives: * Thomas Sabo * Lovisa * Trollbeads * Chamilia (owned by Swarovski, which is telling) * general fashion jewellery substitutes Pandora is basically handing them a free opportunity. Especially Chamilia, which already competes in the charm segment with Swarovski backing and costume jewellery expertise. **12) Moving down-market also blocks moving up-market** Once Pandora damages its brand perception, it traps itself. If it tries to go down-market, it faces OEM competition. If it tries to go up-market later, it faces Trollbeads (higher quality, rarer, less mass-market), Tiffany and Co, David Yurman, and real fine jewellery brands. Pandora copied Trollbeads’ entire concept originally, but Trollbeads has scarcity and craftsmanship Pandora cannot replicate at scale. Pandora has no easy upward path once it abandons its real metal identity. **13) Collabs are at risk: Disney is not guaranteed forever** Pandora has relied heavily on collaborations. Disney (major), Bridgerton (recent), and other branded tie-ins. If Pandora’s perceived quality collapses, those partner brands may reassess whether they want their IP associated with cheap plated jewellery. Disney already sells down-market costume jewellery. Pandora was attractive because it was above that tier. If Pandora becomes indistinguishable from lower market costume products, Disney can demand better terms, reduce partnership intensity, or walk entirely. Losing Disney would be catastrophic because Disney products are a meaningful share of Pandora’s demand engine. **14) The core problem: Pandora cannot detach itself from materials like true luxury can** In high jewellery, brands can charge massive premiums over metal value because they have centuries of heritage, design leadership, cultural prestige, craftsmanship narratives, and scarcity. Pandora has none of those moats. Pandora’s moat is scale, distribution, and real metal at accessible prices. If Pandora removes the real metal component, they are betting that their logo alone can support premium pricing. That is a luxury fashion assumption. And it is wrong. Even in luxury jewellery and fashion, materials still matter. Construction quality still matters. People still care about what they are actually buying. In high jewellery, materials matter even more than brand in the vast majority of cases. A Cartier necklace still needs to be gold. A Van Cleef piece still needs to be constructed properly. A Boucheron client still cares about stone quality. Pandora seems to be forgetting that jewellery is not champagne. Jewellery is not a t-shirt. Jewellery is not perfume. You cannot strip out the material value and expect the brand to survive unchanged. **Conclusion: This is not margin management, it is a value-destructive decision** Pandora switching from sterling silver to platinum-plated alloy is like a premium denim brand switching from real denim to polyester to protect margins. The spreadsheet looks better short term. The brand is structurally impaired long term. Pandora is not moving into a new innovative category. They are voluntarily stepping down into costume jewellery, a market that is smaller ($31 to $45B), brutally commoditised, structurally dominated by fashion houses and OEM mass production, and historically a graveyard for mid-tier premium brands. And they are doing it with the worst possible product format (daily-wear charm bracelets and rings), guaranteeing that plating failure becomes a consumer meme. Once the meme exists, Pandora’s pricing power collapses. Once pricing power collapses, Pandora is forced down-market. Once Pandora is down-market, it is fighting Shein and OEM factories. And that is not a business model. That is slow liquidation disguised as strategy. If shareholders are rational, they should fight this decision aggressively before Pandora permanently destroys the one thing that made the company valuable. Its position as the world’s default real jewellery for normal people. This is irreversible brand damage. **TL;DR:** Pandora switching from sterling silver to platinum-plated alloy is not a harmless cost-saving move. It is a structural downgrade that destroys the material value floor and “real jewellery” perception that underpins their pricing power. Because Pandora is daily-wear jewellery (bracelets, rings), plating wear and tarnish complaints will explode, damaging brand equity and forcing them down-market into a commoditised costume jewellery segment where they will be crushed by OEM imports and cheaper competitors. Swarovski works because it has a distinct crystal identity and reinvention narrative. Pandora’s move reads as cost-cutting and downgrade, not reinvention. If I were a shareholder, I would actively campaign against this decision. **(P.S. Sorry for the long post.)**", "score": 0, "num_comments": 18, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1r0023k/pandora_cphpndora_going_plated_is_brand/", "post_url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1r0023k/pandora_cphpndora_going_plated_is_brand/"}

I should have suspected something was wrong, it was higher than I thought. I apologize for the error. However, since the ARPU figure is based on 2025, and completely discounts future ad market growth until 2030, you can make your own adjustment to get a higher ARPU by 2030.

Many people have offered their bullish and bearish opinions but very few are rooting their claims in quantifiable facts. I am delving into the numbers in detail in order to truly verify the fair value of Reddit. To cut through the noise, I am getting the fair value by projecting out to 2030, estimating the revenue of each geographical segment. Based on the estimation below, I categorise Reddit’s fair value into 4 possible outcomes:l # FAIR VALUE PRICE TARGETS * **Ultra Bull Case (Max Limit, Very Very Unlikely): $638.22** * **Very Optimistic Reasonable Case (Unlikely): $294.95** * **Reasonable Case: $183.88** * **Bear Case: $96.09** Feel free to go through the step by step analysis below and provide feedbacks. # FAIR VALUE CALCULATION (DECEMBER 2030 Projections) Below represents the detailed breakdown of US, EU, and ROW (Rest of World) metrics for each scenario, discounted back to January 2026. |Metric|Bear Case|Reasonable Case|Very Optimistic|Ultra Bull| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |**--- US SEGMENT ---**||||| |US DAU|60M|60M|60M|60M| |US ARPU|$62|$102|$156|$312| |US Revenue|$3.70B|$6.12B|$9.36B|$18.72B| |||||| |**--- EU SEGMENT ---**||||| |EU DAU|30M|30M|30M|30M| |EU ARPU|$25|$40|$62|$124| |EU Revenue|$0.74B|$1.20B|$1.86B|$3.72B| |||||| |**--- ROW SEGMENT ---**||||| |ROW DAU|70M|70M|70M|70M| |ROW ARPU|$5|$8|$12|$25| |ROW Revenue|$0.35B|$0.56B|$0.87B|$1.75B| |||||| |**--- VALUATION ---**||||| |Total Revenue as of 2030|$4.83B|$7.88B|$12.00B|$24.19B| |5 year CAGR Growth (2025 - 2030)|17.0%|29.0%|40.4%|61.5%| |Net Margins|30%|30%|30%|30%| |Total Profit as as of 2030|$1.45B|$2.36B|$3.60B|$7.20B| |PE Ratio|18x|23x|25x|28x| |2030 Market Cap|$26.1B|$54.28B|$90.0B|$201.0B| |**Jan 2026 Mkt Cap (PV)**|**$17.76B**|**$36.94B**|**$61.25B**|**$136.80B**| |**PV of Cumulative FCF + Net Cash** |**$4.11B**|**$4.91B**|**$5.88B**|**$8.46B**| |**Fair Value per Share**|**$96.09**|**$183.88**|**$294.95**|**$638.22**| # ASSUMPTIONS **Outstanding shares** Based on fully diluted outstanding shares of 206.1 million (as of 2025) multiplied by a share dilution rate of 2% a year until 2030 (Management guided between 1% to 3%), which gives us 227.6 million outstanding shares by 2030. **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)** ARPU is based on Ceiling ARPU. Ceiling ARPU is the theoretical maximum ARPU Reddit can reach. It is based on META’s estimated 2025 ARPU. The rationale for this is that Reddit is very unlikely to exceed META’s ARPU, given META’s unrivalled ad tech stack. Since META stop disclosing geographical ARPU after 2023, we simply multiply 2023 ARPU by 1.2x, as META has grown revenue since, to get META 2025 ARPU. ***Reddit’s ARPU assumption per scenario:*** * **Ultra Bull Case ARPU** = META Full 2025 ARPU. This is very very unlikely as Reddit can never replicate META’s ad tech stack within a short 5 years, and may never will. * Very optimistic Reasonable Case = 50% \\* META 2025 ARPU. Twitter’s ARPU back in 2022 was half that of META’s. BUT it was an even higher percentage before 2022, but it stagnated and META continued to grow. Because ARPU is not guaranteed to keep growing without a really good ad tech stack, I consider this scenario to be very optimistic, and unlikely. * **Reasonable Case** = 33% \\* META 2025 ARPU. I consider a third of META’s ARPU to be reasonable. So far, Reddit manages to achieve strong ARPU growth but this is also due to a low base effect. Twitter or Snapchat also recorded rapid ARPU growth in their early stage but saturated and stagnated after a period of time. This tells us that without a proven ad tech stack, we wont really know if Reddit can achieve continuous ARPU growth like the Tier 1 players, Google and META. I m also listing down reasons why I think Reddit ARPU will remain below that of META. * **Bear Case** = 20% x META 2025 ARPU. Reddit can no longer improve its ad conversion performance. ***Reasons why I think Reddit ARPU will remain below that of META:*** The negative reasons: 1. Reddit is text based scrolling, which is not that good for ads. 2. Reddit users has lower engagement duration compared to META users. 3. Reddit is anonymous, and has inherently inferior ad targeting capabilities. 4. Reddit users in ROW is fragmented, with multiple tiny local communities in each country, this makes it hard for ROW local advertisers to justify buying Reddit ads. I live in a Non-Western country with one of the biggest non-Western Reddit community, I have never seen a local AD. Whereas META and Google have tonnes of it. 5. Reddit users are anti Ads, takes a lot of experiment to get it right, dissuading advertisers. The positive reasons: 1. Reddit allows niche targeting and interest-based targeting according the subs theme. 2. Reddit has a sizable user base that do not overlap with other social media platforms (30% to 70%, spending on which platform). To target these people, advertisers must advertise on Reddit. **DAU** End-2025 DAU: **US:** 52.5 million **EU** (estimated): 24.3 million **ROW:** 44.6 million Total DAU: 121.4 million Reddit does not disclose EU DAU. The DAU is estimated from the 2024 data by WorldPopulationReview who collated data from Statista and Semrush. The data shows around 25% are from EU. However, I m just assuming 20% as ROW is growing faster than EU and US in 2025. **DAU growth** The reason I m not changing forecasted DAU for each scenario is because the DAU growth potential is pretty much fixed. The most important number is US DAU, EU and ROW DAU will not move the needle much. We know that US DAU is stagnating as Reddit appeals to a much smaller base of customers. **Price to Earnings (PE)** I consider the PE assigned to the stock to be highly intertwined with ARPU performance, which is in turn highly intertwined with Ad Conversion Performance. If Reddit can’t keep improving its ad conversion performance, it can’t grow ARPU fast, and it does not deserve a high valuation. META’s PE has average at around 25 since 2017, despite consistently growing earnings by 25%+ a year, reflecting a PEG ratio of 1, meaning PE 25 is indeed the fair value for META. As such, the future growth rate will determine the acceptable PE. * **Ultra Bull Case** * Historical 5 years CAGR: 61.5% * Future 5 years CAGR: 30% * Assigned PE: 28 * **Very Optimistic Bull Case** * Historical 5 years CAGR: 40.3% * Future 5 years CAGR: 25% * Assigned PE: 25 * **Reasonable Case** * Historical 5 years CAGR: 29% * Future 5 years CAGR: 18% * Assigned PE: 23 (Note: PE should be higher than growth because Reddit is a high ROIC business; 20 is too low for a capital light business that is growing at more than 15% a year). * **Bear Case** * Historical 5 years CAGR: 17% * Future 5 years CAGR: 10% * Assigned PE: 18 (Note: 15 is too low for a capital light business that is growing at more than 8% a year). **Present Value Discount Rate** We use 8% as the discount rate. **Present Value of Cumulative FCF** We assume a reinvestment rate of 50% from 2026 to 2030. That leaves the other 50% of FCF that can potentially goes into share buybacks, which amounts to the cumulative FCF in the table. **Net Margins** We should assume industry average net margins, \\~30%. While Reddit has shown it can deliver higher margins, it also has a strong affinity for share based compensation and I believe it is only healthy to spend on things like R&D and marketing expenses. Additionally, Q42025 net profit margin excludes income tax because it is benefitting from carry forward tax benefits. US tax is 21%. # FACTORS LEFT OUT OF THE FAIR VALUE CALCULATION FOR SIMPLICITY SAKE Factors leading to underestimation (upside risk) 1. **Growth in Ceiling ARPU.** This analysis assumes the ceiling ARPU stays stagnant from 2026 to 2030, despite the continued growth of online ad market. We could have underestimated the ceiling ARPU by 2030. 2. **Additional levers of DAU growth.** I am projecting stagnant US DAU because Reddit has already saturated the US market. However, Reddit can overcome saturation with two more levers of DAU growth: First, converting logged out users to logged in users, Second, converting MAU to DAU. 3. **Outstanding shares based on 2030.** I have calculated 2025 Fair Value per share by dividing discounted market cap by outstanding shares expected as of 2030. The reason for this is it is difficult to factor in the exact impact of the dilution in our current valuation framework. Factors leading to overestimation (downside risk) 1. **Share dilution risk.** I think this is a big risk. I really do not understand what’s the management’s intention on this. They mentioned keep dilution rate per year at 1% to 3%. But that could mean a lot of things. Example, they can dilute the share base by 5% and then buy back 2% using FCF, resulting in 3% dilution. They also have a very big multi year share compensation package in 2024, this concerns me a lot as it may repeat in the future. 2. **Limited English Speakers outside US, Europe and India.** This means Reddit has a lower Total Addressable Market. I also note that most countries have their own internet forums that are entrenched in their respective societies. 3. **There is no certainty that Reddit can keep improving its ad conversion performance.** If Reddit fails to do that, stock will significantly rerate downwards. 4. **Net profit margin too optimistic.** I think this is a big risk. Q42025 net profit margin is 35%. However, on a normalized tax basis, meaning without the carryforward tax loss benefits, its Q42025 net profit margins is actually 28%. Additionally, it is hard to achieve significant growth without really high R&D expenses. But I m too lazy to deal with it, so I m putting profit margin at 30%. I believe Redditors will also strongly disagree that I put it any lower. Personally, I would assume a lower net profit margin. #", "text": "Enough with the opinions. Here is the actual math and analysis on Reddit’s Fair Value. Reasonable Fair Value: $183. # FAIR VALUE PRICE TARGETS There are a lot of noises surrounding Reddit’s fair value. Many people have offered their bullish and bearish opinions but very few are rooting their claims in quantifiable facts. I am delving into the numbers in detail in order to truly verify the fair value of Reddit. To cut through the noise, I am getting the fair value by projecting out to 2030, estimating the revenue of each geographical segment. Based on the estimation below, I categorise Reddit’s fair value into 4 possible outcomes:l # FAIR VALUE PRICE TARGETS * **Ultra Bull Case (Max Limit, Very Very Unlikely): $638.22** * **Very Optimistic Reasonable Case (Unlikely): $294.95** * **Reasonable Case: $183.88** * **Bear Case: $96.09** Feel free to go through the step by step analysis below and provide feedbacks. # FAIR VALUE CALCULATION (DECEMBER 2030 Projections) Below represents the detailed breakdown of US, EU, and ROW (Rest of World) metrics for each scenario, discounted back to January 2026. |Metric|Bear Case|Reasonable Case|Very Optimistic|Ultra Bull| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |**--- US SEGMENT ---**||||| |US DAU|60M|60M|60M|60M| |US ARPU|$62|$102|$156|$312| |US Revenue|$3.70B|$6.12B|$9.36B|$18.72B| |||||| |**--- EU SEGMENT ---**||||| |EU DAU|30M|30M|30M|30M| |EU ARPU|$25|$40|$62|$124| |EU Revenue|$0.74B|$1.20B|$1.86B|$3.72B| |||||| |**--- ROW SEGMENT ---**||||| |ROW DAU|70M|70M|70M|70M| |ROW ARPU|$5|$8|$12|$25| |ROW Revenue|$0.35B|$0.56B|$0.87B|$1.75B| |||||| |**--- VALUATION ---**||||| |Total Revenue as of 2030|$4.83B|$7.88B|$12.00B|$24.19B| |5 year CAGR Growth (2025 - 2030)|17.0%|29.0%|40.4%|61.5%| |Net Margins|30%|30%|30%|30%| |Total Profit as as of 2030|$1.45B|$2.36B|$3.60B|$7.20B| |PE Ratio|18x|23x|25x|28x| |2030 Market Cap|$26.1B|$54.28B|$90.0B|$201.0B| |**Jan 2026 Mkt Cap (PV)**|**$17.76B**|**$36.94B**|**$61.25B**|**$136.80B**| |**PV of Cumulative FCF + Net Cash** |**$4.11B**|**$4.91B**|**$5.88B**|**$8.46B**| |**Fair Value per Share**|**$96.09**|**$183.88**|**$294.95**|**$638.22**| # ASSUMPTIONS **Outstanding shares** Based on fully diluted outstanding shares of 206.1 million (as of 2025) multiplied by a share dilution rate of 2% a year until 2030 (Management guided between 1% to 3%), which gives us 227.6 million outstanding shares by 2030. **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)** ARPU is based on Ceiling ARPU. Ceiling ARPU is the theoretical maximum ARPU Reddit can reach. It is based on META’s estimated 2025 ARPU. The rationale for this is that Reddit is very unlikely to exceed META’s ARPU, given META’s unrivalled ad tech stack. Since META stop disclosing geographical ARPU after 2023, we simply multiply 2023 ARPU by 1.2x, as META has grown revenue since, to get META 2025 ARPU. ***Reddit’s ARPU assumption per scenario:*** * **Ultra Bull Case ARPU** = META Full 2025 ARPU. This is very very unlikely as Reddit can never replicate META’s ad tech stack within a short 5 years, and may never will. * Very optimistic Reasonable Case = 50% \\* META 2025 ARPU. Twitter’s ARPU back in 2022 was half that of META’s. BUT it was an even higher percentage before 2022, but it stagnated and META continued to grow. Because ARPU is not guaranteed to keep growing without a really good ad tech stack, I consider this scenario to be very optimistic, and unlikely. * **Reasonable Case** = 33% \\* META 2025 ARPU. I consider a third of META’s ARPU to be reasonable. So far, Reddit manages to achieve strong ARPU growth but this is also due to a low base effect. Twitter or Snapchat also recorded rapid ARPU growth in their early stage but saturated and stagnated after a period of time. This tells us that without a proven ad tech stack, we wont really know if Reddit can achieve continuous ARPU growth like the Tier 1 players, Google and META. I m also listing down reasons why I think Reddit ARPU will remain below that of META. * **Bear Case** = 20% x META 2025 ARPU. Reddit can no longer improve its ad conversion performance. ***Reasons why I think Reddit ARPU will remain below that of META:*** The negative reasons: 1. Reddit is text based scrolling, which is not that good for ads. 2. Reddit users has lower engagement duration compared to META users. 3. Reddit is anonymous, and has inherently inferior ad targeting capabilities. 4. Reddit users in ROW is fragmented, with multiple tiny local communities in each country, this makes it hard for ROW local advertisers to justify buying Reddit ads. I live in a Non-Western country with one of the biggest non-Western Reddit community, I have never seen a local AD. Whereas META and Google have tonnes of it. 5. Reddit users are anti Ads, takes a lot of experiment to get it right, dissuading advertisers. The positive reasons: 1. Reddit allows niche targeting and interest-based targeting according the subs theme. 2. Reddit has a sizable user base that do not overlap with other social media platforms (30% to 70%, spending on which platform). To target these people, advertisers must advertise on Reddit. **DAU** End-2025 DAU: **US:** 52.5 million **EU** (estimated): 24.3 million **ROW:** 44.6 million Total DAU: 121.4 million Reddit does not disclose EU DAU.

The Google trade seemed too easy to be profitable. And now, everybody thinks each company is vibe-coding their own Office suite, cybersecurity and operating systems lol.

Don't freak out especially if you want to have a long career investing. And you should. It's one way the little man can make any money without inheriting millions from a rich family member. And if all else fails... a few 0dte calls on 3x ETFs couldn't hurt...right?

Carvana also came under fire last month after a short seller report by Gotham City Capital questioning their sub-prime lending and accounting practices. Now CVNA has given off a strongly Bearish technical signal as it's 20 day EMA crossed its 50 day SMA in what is often called a \"Bear Cross\" or a \"Death Cross.\" (Can I say that here? Do I have to write Unalive Cross?) I am the first to admit that technical analysis is about as accurate as tarot readings or Voodoo magic. However, the last 2 times CVNA's moving averages crossed like they did today the stock fell dramatically over the coming weeks. In March of 2025 CVNA went through a Bear Cross and fell from $220 to $162. In October 2025 CVNA fell from $357 to $285 after a Bear Cross. As of 4pm today (2/5/2026) CVNA traded at a lofty $383 a share, a significant drop off from their $490 peak after inclusion in the S&P500, but still a staggering 78 times their reported annual income. Between geopolitical turmoil, risk-off selling, the recent short seller report, and now this clearly bearish technical signal, it seems highly likely CVNA will continue their precipitous fall. As I have posted before, I have current open put option positions against CVNA and intend to continue to short CVNA stock for the immediate future. I may open or close other positions with no prior notice. Year to date this short trade is up over 34%, and I have no intention of letting off CVNA until their market cap approaches a more appropriate enterprise value. I am not a Financial Advisor.

A broad look at Saas and its roll in our AI future.", "selftext": "I've been a software engineer for 14 years now and have been through a lot of iterations of software over my time and AI has been one of the most fun and exciting revolutions in recent history for me. I have been reflecting on it as of late due to the market fears, comments about AI being useless, and others saying its revolutionary. **The Fears:** **Seat Compression:** Less licenses, less money. **Commoditization of Code:** Code is cheap, \"Lowering the MOAT\". **Economic Displacement**: White collar jobs are replaced by software. **Types of SaaS:** Systems of Engagement - DOCU, ZM Systems of Record - CRM, NOW WKDY Cybersecurity - PANW, CRWD, NET, ZS Infrastructure & Data - SNOW, DDOG, MGDB Specialty - SNPS, CDNS, SAP, CSU, VEEV, INTU DevOps - TEAM, GTLB Hyper Scalars: Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft (All down like 20% +) **My thoughts:** I spent some time trying to understand why INTU in particular has been hit so hard. My wife has a small business and for payroll there aren't a lot of great options outside of intuit. **Commoditization of code**: was what I found to be the most prevalent \"disruptor\" to Intuit. For example, if Google or a startup could link into your bank accounts, and agentically pull your banking records and automatically compute payroll or expenses it would remove the need for Intuit. There is also some fear of an AI advisor, but an AI advisor that is bound by any real responsibility is questionable at best. While I was working through this case study with Gemini, it pointed out Google could do this at some point but it would incur fiduciary responsibility and lawsuit risk. It dawned on me and its been true for the last 10 years. Google, Amazon, Microsoft and these other tech giants have hoards of the best software engineers for the last 20 years and aren't going to start entering an accounting space for a 100B dollar market cap company. If giants won't enter this space what about the small guys? A small scrappy start up? Does AI make VC money so much more efficient that they can bust into highly established business processes or highly regulated markets? Are they so much more efficient now, that the business's weren't worth pursuing before? What is that multiple?

You are always going to have overhead with these startups, cloud hosting, security, snow, ddog, you name it. Half of these **\"seat compressions\"** will be filled with the competitors trying to disrupt the kings. AI hasn't \"changed software\", it still does the same thing. Startups don't have some implied advantage because the game has changed. They can just work faster now like everyone else. There are some fun inferences you can make with AI and the logic you can build around it but functionally the results are the same. One last thing.

Do your own research and be patient.", "text": "SaaS - The Fears, The Future, The Opportunities. A broad look at Saas and its roll in our AI future. I've been a software engineer for 14 years now and have been through a lot of iterations of software over my time and AI has been one of the most fun and exciting revolutions in recent history for me. I have been reflecting on it as of late due to the market fears, comments about AI being useless, and others saying its revolutionary. **The Fears:** **Seat Compression:** Less licenses, less money. **Commoditization of Code:** Code is cheap, \"Lowering the MOAT\". **Economic Displacement**: White collar jobs are replaced by software. **Types of SaaS:** Systems of Engagement - DOCU, ZM Systems of Record - CRM, NOW WKDY Cybersecurity - PANW, CRWD, NET, ZS Infrastructure & Data - SNOW, DDOG, MGDB Specialty - SNPS, CDNS, SAP, CSU, VEEV, INTU DevOps - TEAM, GTLB Hyper Scalars: Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft (All down like 20% +) **My thoughts:** I spent some time trying to understand why INTU in particular has been hit so hard. My wife has a small business and for payroll there aren't a lot of great options outside of intuit. **Commoditization of code**: was what I found to be the most prevalent \"disruptor\" to Intuit. For example, if Google or a startup could link into your bank accounts, and agentically pull your banking records and automatically compute payroll or expenses it would remove the need for Intuit. There is also some fear of an AI advisor, but an AI advisor that is bound by any real responsibility is questionable at best. While I was working through this case study with Gemini, it pointed out Google could do this at some point but it would incur fiduciary responsibility and lawsuit risk. It dawned on me and its been true for the last 10 years. Google, Amazon, Microsoft and these other tech giants have hoards of the best software engineers for the last 20 years and aren't going to start entering an accounting space for a 100B dollar market cap company. If giants won't enter this space what about the small guys? A small scrappy start up?

(NYSE: SNAP) has experienced significant volatility over the past several years, currently trading in the mid-single to low-double digit range depending on market sentiment and earnings cycles. The stock remains well below its historical highs, reflecting broader pressure across digital advertising platforms as well as company-specific challenges related to user monetization and competition. Snap originally gained traction as a fast-growing social media platform built around ephemeral messaging, augmented reality features, and a strong appeal among younger demographics. At its peak growth stage, the company benefited from rapid user adoption and increasing advertiser demand for mobile-focused engagement tools. However, the digital advertising landscape has changed significantly over the last few years, creating both structural and cyclical challenges for Snap’s business model. From a financial perspective, Snap has experienced periods of slowing revenue growth. Recent earnings reports have shown quarterly revenue growth that has moderated compared to earlier expansion phases. Advertising remains the company’s primary revenue driver, and fluctuations in advertiser spending have had a direct impact on top-line performance. Macroeconomic uncertainty has also influenced advertising budgets across multiple industries, creating additional volatility in Snap’s revenue trends. User growth has remained relatively stable, with Snap continuing to report strong daily active user engagement, particularly among Gen Z demographics. However, investor concerns increasingly focus on monetization efficiency rather than raw user growth. Average revenue per user has faced pressure as advertisers evaluate return on investment and shift budgets between competing platforms such as Meta, TikTok, and emerging social video ecosystems. On the cost side, Snap has implemented multiple restructuring initiatives aimed at improving operating efficiency. Over the past two years, the company reduced workforce size and consolidated several internal product divisions. Management has emphasized streamlining product development while prioritizing core revenue-generating features. These cost reduction measures have improved operating discipline but have not fully offset revenue growth concerns. Snap has continued to invest heavily in augmented reality and artificial intelligence capabilities as long-term differentiation strategies. The company’s AR lens ecosystem and creator tools remain among the most advanced within social media platforms. Snap has positioned these tools as future monetization channels through branded AR advertising, creator partnerships, and interactive commerce experiences. While these technologies offer long-term potential, near-term revenue contribution remains uncertain and dependent on advertiser adoption. Competitive pressure remains one of Snap’s most significant strategic challenges. Larger platforms with broader user ecosystems benefit from scale advantages in advertising analytics, targeting infrastructure, and cross-platform engagement. TikTok’s rapid expansion in short-form video and Meta’s continued investment in AI-driven ad targeting have intensified competition for user attention and advertiser budgets. From a trading standpoint, SNAP has demonstrated elevated volatility around earnings announcements, macro advertising trends, and broader technology sector sentiment. Technical patterns have shown repeated testing of support levels during weaker advertising cycles, followed by sharp rallies during periods of improved guidance or stronger user engagement metrics. Trading volume often increases significantly during earnings releases, indicating strong institutional and retail participation. Long-term strategic outlook for Snap largely depends on the company’s ability to improve advertising monetization while maintaining strong user engagement among younger demographics. The platform’s brand identity and cultural relevance remain valuable intangible assets. Additionally, Snap’s early leadership in AR technology may provide strategic optionality if immersive digital advertising and social commerce adoption accelerate over time. However, several risk factors remain. Advertising spending remains highly cyclical and sensitive to economic conditions. Competition for digital advertising share continues to intensify across social media platforms. Additionally, continued investment in emerging technologies requires balancing long-term innovation with near-term profitability expectations. From a valuation perspective, SNAP often trades based on forward growth expectations rather than current profitability metrics. This dynamic contributes to higher volatility relative to more mature advertising platforms. Investor sentiment tends to shift rapidly based on revenue growth trajectories and management guidance regarding advertiser demand. Overall, Snap represents a technology platform transitioning from early hyper-growth toward a more mature monetization and efficiency-focused phase. The company retains strong brand recognition and technological differentiation in augmented reality, but its ability to translate engagement into sustainable advertising revenue remains the central investment debate.

Saved me lot of pain (and gains).", "selftext": "I learnt last year about how Mark Cuban saved his fortune during dot com bubble burst with a collar options trade (for the stocks he got when he sold his company). Mid last year, a lot of stocks from my portfolio such as Affirm, QS, Sofi, etc were doing very well. They were at their respective ATH. Getting out that point would have got good gains but all would have added to overall tax (including some STCG). And nobody knew if these stocks were going to make further ATH. So apart from potential higher taxes, the FOMO on new ATH in each of these bigger winners was as real as it could get in an exuberant market. But then, what if market reverses the direction from here ? The collar trade addressed most of those feelings and concerns - gave that chance to wait and see if new ATH are achieved while also protecting from the downside. Cost was just a little premium (collar results in less net premium than just buying a put as you sell a CC - and if you choose different months for the put and calls, the cost could be 0 or even positive). Eg. QS reached highs n late 2025. And now it is back to \\~8 (down 50% than the highs). But a collar position with expiry in 2026, I paid just a little premium - allowed me to wait to see if I can sell my position even at higher prices.

Saved me lot of pain (and gains). I learnt last year about how Mark Cuban saved his fortune during dot com bubble burst with a collar options trade (for the stocks he got when he sold his company). Mid last year, a lot of stocks from my portfolio such as Affirm, QS, Sofi, etc were doing very well. They were at their respective ATH. Getting out that point would have got good gains but all would have added to overall tax (including some STCG). And nobody knew if these stocks were going to make further ATH. So apart from potential higher taxes, the FOMO on new ATH in each of these bigger winners was as real as it could get in an exuberant market. But then, what if market reverses the direction from here ? The collar trade addressed most of those feelings and concerns - gave that chance to wait and see if new ATH are achieved while also protecting from the downside. Cost was just a little premium (collar results in less net premium than just buying a put as you sell a CC - and if you choose different months for the put and calls, the cost could be 0 or even positive). Eg. QS reached highs n late 2025. And now it is back to \\~8 (down 50% than the highs). But a collar position with expiry in 2026, I paid just a little premium - allowed me to wait to see if I can sell my position even at higher prices. And gave me right to sell at \\~16 even if stock goes down - which turned out the case. Now even when it is at \\~8, I shall be able to sell at \\~$16. I can reenter and then DCA some of these names again if the market keeps deteriorating. I wish, I had known this in 2021/22 when we had such peaks and then big drops. Sharing as it has helped me.

I'm getting emails.** The full reason anyone in the last 2 years should have invested in PayPal was due to their ads platform. However, PayPal made a huge mistake here not making this the main focus. Who is Mark? Well, in 2019 Mark sold his company to Amazon. Amazon then took it's ad unit from $10B to $30B in revenue. Uber hired Mark. In 2022 to 2024, Mark took Uber's ad business to $0 to $1B in revenue. What is PayPals Ad Manager? Let's act as if this was my own website. My post will get thousands of clicks but no monetization. Now, with PayPal ads, I can integrate their SDK into my website, and within minutes start running ads on this post. (Not this actual post but if it was my site) This allows for PayPal to get high margin dollars. For example, if PayPal can scale their AD unit to $2B revenue at 50% margins, they would go from $5-6B net income, to $6-7B net income, and slowly go higher overtime. This is the setup the stock needs to go $100+ \\#3. PayPal Integrations - People seem to forget, PayPal has spent the last 20 years accepting PayPal. This means users/businesses all get free advertising to PayPal. No matter what, naturally PayPal will grow for the next 5-10 years. Does it need more social growth? People choosing to actually want it? Yes. As an online business, if I'm not accepting PayPal I'm at a huge disadvantage. People use PayPal for their chargeback protection. I'm confident anytime I buy with PayPal I'm protected. Side Note: PayPal's and Venmo's cashback and credit card programs are some of the highest cashback you can get anywhere on the internet. **The moat remains in ads. PayPal's entire focus needs to shift to running ads.** **Also if you bought PayPal in the last 2 years, to sell now, ask yourself, why? PayPal ads release in early 2026.
