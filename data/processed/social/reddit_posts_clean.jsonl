Silver downgrade kills pricing power. Bear case + puts thesis", "selftext": "Pandora’s recent decision to pivot away from sterling silver and toward platinum-plated jewellery (over their proprietary “Ever-shine” base alloy) is being framed as a smart response to the surge in silver prices. In reality, I think it is one of the worst strategic decisions I have seen from a mass-market luxury-adjacent consumer brand in years. This is not margin optimisation. This is Pandora fundamentally misunderstanding what business it is in, massively overestimating its brand power, and walking directly into a smaller, uglier, structurally inferior market. If I was a shareholder, I would actively campaign against this decision. **1) This decision screams CEO misread (wrong playbook, wrong industry)** Pandora’s new CEO, **Berta de Pablos-Barbier**, has a background that makes this decision make perfect sense to her, while being disastrous for Pandora: * President and CEO of LVMH’s champagne brands (Moët & Chandon, Dom Pérignon, Mercier) * CMO of Lacoste * Senior roles at Boucheron This is a person trained in the world of brand-first luxury, where the product itself is secondary to image, story, and logo. That logic works for champagne (where brand is the product), fashion houses (where the logo is the asset), and high jewellery (where heritage and design allow huge premiums over metal value). Pandora is not in those categories. Pandora is mass-market entry-level luxury jewellery. Their customers are not paying for a 200-year history. They are paying for an accessible version of real jewellery. The problem is that this decision reflects an executive worldview shaped by industries where you can detach the product from the underlying materials and still charge premium prices. Pandora cannot do that. Pandora is not a fashion brand that happens to sell jewellery. Pandora is a jewellery company with a brand premium. And that distinction is everything. **2) Pandora is a jewellery company first, and a brand second** People keep discussing Pandora as if it is a fashion-style brand business where the logo is the product and the underlying materials are irrelevant. It is not. Pandora is, first and foremost, a jewellery company. The brand matters, but it is an overlay on top of the product, not a substitute for it. Pandora’s pricing power exists because customers believe they are buying: * real jewellery (sterling silver) * branded jewellery (so it has trust and resale value) * sentimental jewellery (giftable, symbolic, personal) Pandora is not competing purely on design, scarcity, or craftsmanship. They are competing on the idea that you can buy something real, durable, and valuable without paying Tiffany prices. That is why Pandora can charge significantly more than Chinese and Indian OEM jewellery and unbranded charm products. Their customers might not understand metal markets, but they absolutely understand the difference between: * sterling silver * plated alloy Even if they cannot articulate it, they feel it instinctively. **3) Sterling silver gives Pandora a resale floor that plating destroys** Sterling silver is currently around **$2.40 per gram**. That means Pandora jewellery has something costume jewellery does not. It has an embedded commodity floor value. Even if the jewellery is scratched, damaged, or destroyed, the owner can still scrap it. That matters psychologically even if most customers never actually do it. And beyond melt value, Pandora pieces often resell above scrap because the brand adds a premium. This is why Pandora works so well as a gift product. It feels like a real asset. Now compare that to plated alloy. Platinum plating sounds luxurious, but in reality the amount of platinum used is microscopic. It is essentially dusting the surface. Even if Pandora’s Ever-shine alloy is decent, the scrap value of the metal content in a small charm is basically nothing. You are not going to take a plated charm to a jeweller and get meaningful money for it. If sterling silver is roughly $2.40 per gram, the metal value of a plated charm is closer to something like **$0.01 to $0.06 per gram**, depending on the alloy, plating thickness, and composition. Pandora’s alloy is proprietary so we cannot know exactly, but the point is obvious. From the customer’s perspective, the intrinsic value of plated alloy jewellery is effectively **zero**. So Pandora is destroying the “worst case” floor that has supported its pricing power for decades. Pandora’s management seems to think customers will not notice because the jewellery still looks shiny and premium. They will notice. Because the next step is predictable. The deeper issue is what this decision signals to the market. If Pandora has to strip out sterling silver to protect margins, it is effectively admitting that their historical profitability depended on selling precious metal at a premium. In other words, their pricing power may have been weaker than investors assumed. A company with true brand-led pricing power would pass higher input costs through to consumers. A company forced to downgrade materials is signalling that it cannot. **4) Pandora is making the worst possible product for plating: daily-wear jewellery** Plated jewellery can work in costume jewellery because most costume jewellery is worn occasionally. It is statement pieces worn to events, nights out, or parties, often larger necklaces, cuffs, and bangles. Those items do not see heavy daily wear. Pandora’s core products are the exact opposite: * charm bracelets * rings * stackable pieces * things people wear every day I personally know multiple people who wear their Pandora charm bracelet daily without taking it off. Daily wear is brutal. Constant friction, sweat, soap, perfume exposure, banging against surfaces, repeated abrasion on bracelet links and charm holes. Plating will wear off. Once it wears off, you get tarnish, discolouration, skin staining, and turning green complaints. And it does not matter how much Pandora insists their alloy is premium or proprietary. All it takes is one widely-shared meme: **Pandora turns green now.** And the brand is permanently damaged. Pandora is voluntarily walking into a predictable consumer backlash cycle that has destroyed countless mid-market jewellery brands. **5) This move forces Pandora into costume jewellery whether they admit it or not** If you remove sterling silver as the core material, Pandora becomes costume jewellery. This is not an opinion. It is literally a category shift. They can call it innovation or sustainability or new materials, but the consumer translation is simple: **Pandora is plated jewellery now.** And that is the exact positioning Pandora spent decades avoiding. Pandora’s customers did not choose Pandora because they wanted fashion accessories. They chose Pandora because it felt like the cheapest way to buy real jewellery with status attached. That is what is being destroyed. **6) The costume jewellery market is smaller, uglier, and structurally terrible** People do not understand how important market structure is here. The global costume jewellery market is valued around **$31 to $45 billion (2023 to 2024).** Now compare that to fine jewellery: * broader global jewellery market is estimated **$350 to $380 billion in 2025** * projected to exceed **$500 billion by 2033** * luxury jewellery segment specifically is **$49 to $66 billion (2024)**, with strong growth driven by Asia-Pacific demand So Pandora is pivoting away from a category adjacent to a hundreds-of-billions global market, and pushing itself into a far smaller, more commoditised, brutally competitive market. This is not a smart pivot. This is moving into a segment with worse economics. Costume jewellery is dominated by two kinds of players. First, fashion houses like Dior, Gucci, Chanel, and so on. They derive pricing power from clothing prestige. The jewellery is just an extension of the logo. Pandora does not have that type of prestige. Second, low-cost fast fashion and OEM supply chains. This is where the real competition is. Chinese and Indian manufacturers producing plated jewellery at absurdly low cost. Once Pandora becomes plated jewellery, it is forced into competition with an industrial machine that will undercut it forever. That is a race to the bottom. **7) History already shows what happens: the mid-tier costume giants collapsed** The best evidence that this market is terrible is that the old dominant names in costume jewellery are either dead or irrelevant. The mid-century American giants include Coro, Trifari, Monet, and Napier. These brands were huge. They had scale, recognition, and distribution. And the market still wiped them out. Some exist as trademarks, but the industrial powerhouses are gone. This is what happens when you sell non-precious jewellery at a premium without the fashion-house prestige moat. Pandora is voluntarily placing itself on the same path. **8) Swarovski exists, but Swarovski’s success proves the opposite of what Pandora thinks** If Pandora wants to play in premium costume jewellery, the obvious comparable is Swarovski. And to be clear, Swarovski is not collapsing. Their jewellery business is actually performing well. Swarovski’s Crystal Business generated **€1.906 billion in revenue in FY2024**, with 6 percent organic growth, jewellery sales growing 9 percent organically, lab-grown diamond sales more than doubling, and the company returning to profitability. So the lesson is not that Swarovski is failing. The lesson is why Swarovski is succeeding. Swarovski’s pricing power comes from something Pandora does not have. A genuine product identity. Swarovski is not generic costume jewellery. Swarovski is crystals. It has a materials story, a visual signature, and an instantly recognisable aesthetic that competitors cannot replicate without being obvious copies. Pandora has no equivalent. And Swarovski’s strategy is built around bold, colourful, extravagant statement design. Their LUXignite strategy positions Swarovski as “pop luxury” built on visual spectacle, plus a credible move into lab-grown diamonds. Pandora cannot replicate that. Pandora’s brand identity is fundamentally understated and sentimental. Its hero products are charm bracelets and stackable everyday pieces. If Swarovski’s identity is spectacle, Pandora’s identity is safe, wearable, and personal. So when Pandora shifts away from sterling silver into plated alloy, it does not read as reinvention. It reads as cost cutting. It reads as downgrade. That is the key difference. Swarovski’s customer experiences an upgrade in design and identity. Pandora’s customer experiences a reduction in material value. And in jewellery, that distinction is fatal. **9) The other comps do not work: Alexis Bittar and Kenneth Jay Lane are not Pandora** Other premium costume jewellery brands include Alexis Bittar and Kenneth Jay Lane. But these brands are design-led and niche. They are aimed at an older, more fashion-forward demographic and built around statement aesthetics. Pandora is the opposite. Mass-market, sentimental gift-driven, everyday wear, repetitive charm concept. Pandora cannot reposition into that design niche without losing its existing customer base. So Pandora is entering a market where it does not have fashion-house prestige, it does not have Swarovski’s crystal identity, and it does not have design-cult uniqueness. Which means it has no moat. **10) Once Pandora’s perceived quality collapses, pricing power is gone forever** Pandora’s current positioning is a very delicate sweet spot. It is above cheap high street jewellery, below fine luxury houses, real enough to justify the spend, accessible enough to be mass-market. That is why Pandora works. But if consumers start associating Pandora with tarnish, plating wear, green skin, and cheap alloy, Pandora loses its premium perception. Once that happens, the market forces Pandora down. They will be forced to cut prices to compete with Thomas Sabo, Lovisa, cheap Amazon brands, Shein-tier jewellery, and Chinese and Indian OEM supply. At that point, Pandora becomes a commodity retailer with a fading logo. And it will never regain its old pricing power. Brand perception moves down quickly and moves up extremely slowly. **11) Competitors will eat them once the brand is weakened** If Pandora loses its sterling silver anchor, competitors will take their market share. There are already strong alternatives: * Thomas Sabo * Lovisa * Trollbeads * Chamilia (owned by Swarovski, which is telling) * general fashion jewellery substitutes Pandora is basically handing them a free opportunity. Especially Chamilia, which already competes in the charm segment with Swarovski backing and costume jewellery expertise. **12) Moving down-market also blocks moving up-market** Once Pandora damages its brand perception, it traps itself. If it tries to go down-market, it faces OEM competition. If it tries to go up-market later, it faces Trollbeads (higher quality, rarer, less mass-market), Tiffany and Co, David Yurman, and real fine jewellery brands. Pandora copied Trollbeads’ entire concept originally, but Trollbeads has scarcity and craftsmanship Pandora cannot replicate at scale. Pandora has no easy upward path once it abandons its real metal identity. **13) Collabs are at risk: Disney is not guaranteed forever** Pandora has relied heavily on collaborations. Disney (major), Bridgerton (recent), and other branded tie-ins. If Pandora’s perceived quality collapses, those partner brands may reassess whether they want their IP associated with cheap plated jewellery. Disney already sells down-market costume jewellery. Pandora was attractive because it was above that tier. If Pandora becomes indistinguishable from lower market costume products, Disney can demand better terms, reduce partnership intensity, or walk entirely. Losing Disney would be catastrophic because Disney products are a meaningful share of Pandora’s demand engine. **14) The core problem: Pandora cannot detach itself from materials like true luxury can** In high jewellery, brands can charge massive premiums over metal value because they have centuries of heritage, design leadership, cultural prestige, craftsmanship narratives, and scarcity. Pandora has none of those moats. Pandora’s moat is scale, distribution, and real metal at accessible prices. If Pandora removes the real metal component, they are betting that their logo alone can support premium pricing. That is a luxury fashion assumption. And it is wrong. Even in luxury jewellery and fashion, materials still matter. Construction quality still matters. People still care about what they are actually buying. In high jewellery, materials matter even more than brand in the vast majority of cases. A Cartier necklace still needs to be gold. A Van Cleef piece still needs to be constructed properly. A Boucheron client still cares about stone quality. Pandora seems to be forgetting that jewellery is not champagne. Jewellery is not a t-shirt. Jewellery is not perfume. You cannot strip out the material value and expect the brand to survive unchanged. **Conclusion: This is not margin management, it is a value-destructive decision** Pandora switching from sterling silver to platinum-plated alloy is like a premium denim brand switching from real denim to polyester to protect margins. The spreadsheet looks better short term. The brand is structurally impaired long term. Pandora is not moving into a new innovative category. They are voluntarily stepping down into costume jewellery, a market that is smaller ($31 to $45B), brutally commoditised, structurally dominated by fashion houses and OEM mass production, and historically a graveyard for mid-tier premium brands. And they are doing it with the worst possible product format (daily-wear charm bracelets and rings), guaranteeing that plating failure becomes a consumer meme. Once the meme exists, Pandora’s pricing power collapses. Once pricing power collapses, Pandora is forced down-market. Once Pandora is down-market, it is fighting Shein and OEM factories. And that is not a business model. That is slow liquidation disguised as strategy. If shareholders are rational, they should fight this decision aggressively before Pandora permanently destroys the one thing that made the company valuable. Its position as the world’s default real jewellery for normal people. This is irreversible brand damage. **TL;DR:** Pandora switching from sterling silver to platinum-plated alloy is not a harmless cost-saving move. It is a structural downgrade that destroys the material value floor and “real jewellery” perception that underpins their pricing power. Because Pandora is daily-wear jewellery (bracelets, rings), plating wear and tarnish complaints will explode, damaging brand equity and forcing them down-market into a commoditised costume jewellery segment where they will be crushed by OEM imports and cheaper competitors. Swarovski works because it has a distinct crystal identity and reinvention narrative. Pandora’s move reads as cost-cutting and downgrade, not reinvention. If I were a shareholder, I would actively campaign against this decision. **(P.S. Sorry for the long post.)**", "text": "Pandora (CPH:PNDORA) going plated is brand destruction.

And to be clear, Swarovski is not collapsing. Their jewellery business is actually performing well. Swarovski’s Crystal Business generated **€1.906 billion in revenue in FY2024**, with 6 percent organic growth, jewellery sales growing 9 percent organically, lab-grown diamond sales more than doubling, and the company returning to profitability. So the lesson is not that Swarovski is failing. The lesson is why Swarovski is succeeding. Swarovski’s pricing power comes from something Pandora does not have. A genuine product identity. Swarovski is not generic costume jewellery. Swarovski is crystals. It has a materials story, a visual signature, and an instantly recognisable aesthetic that competitors cannot replicate without being obvious copies. Pandora has no equivalent. And Swarovski’s strategy is built around bold, colourful, extravagant statement design. Their LUXignite strategy positions Swarovski as “pop luxury” built on visual spectacle, plus a credible move into lab-grown diamonds. Pandora cannot replicate that. Pandora’s brand identity is fundamentally understated and sentimental. Its hero products are charm bracelets and stackable everyday pieces. If Swarovski’s identity is spectacle, Pandora’s identity is safe, wearable, and personal. So when Pandora shifts away from sterling silver into plated alloy, it does not read as reinvention. It reads as cost cutting. It reads as downgrade. That is the key difference. Swarovski’s customer experiences an upgrade in design and identity. Pandora’s customer experiences a reduction in material value. And in jewellery, that distinction is fatal. **9) The other comps do not work: Alexis Bittar and Kenneth Jay Lane are not Pandora** Other premium costume jewellery brands include Alexis Bittar and Kenneth Jay Lane. But these brands are design-led and niche. They are aimed at an older, more fashion-forward demographic and built around statement aesthetics. Pandora is the opposite. Mass-market, sentimental gift-driven, everyday wear, repetitive charm concept. Pandora cannot reposition into that design niche without losing its existing customer base. So Pandora is entering a market where it does not have fashion-house prestige, it does not have Swarovski’s crystal identity, and it does not have design-cult uniqueness. Which means it has no moat. **10) Once Pandora’s perceived quality collapses, pricing power is gone forever** Pandora’s current positioning is a very delicate sweet spot. It is above cheap high street jewellery, below fine luxury houses, real enough to justify the spend, accessible enough to be mass-market. That is why Pandora works. But if consumers start associating Pandora with tarnish, plating wear, green skin, and cheap alloy, Pandora loses its premium perception. Once that happens, the market forces Pandora down. They will be forced to cut prices to compete with Thomas Sabo, Lovisa, cheap Amazon brands, Shein-tier jewellery, and Chinese and Indian OEM supply. At that point, Pandora becomes a commodity retailer with a fading logo. And it will never regain its old pricing power. Brand perception moves down quickly and moves up extremely slowly. **11) Competitors will eat them once the brand is weakened** If Pandora loses its sterling silver anchor, competitors will take their market share. There are already strong alternatives: * Thomas Sabo * Lovisa * Trollbeads * Chamilia (owned by Swarovski, which is telling) * general fashion jewellery substitutes Pandora is basically handing them a free opportunity. Especially Chamilia, which already competes in the charm segment with Swarovski backing and costume jewellery expertise. **12) Moving down-market also blocks moving up-market** Once Pandora damages its brand perception, it traps itself. If it tries to go down-market, it faces OEM competition. If it tries to go up-market later, it faces Trollbeads (higher quality, rarer, less mass-market), Tiffany and Co, David Yurman, and real fine jewellery brands. Pandora copied Trollbeads’ entire concept originally, but Trollbeads has scarcity and craftsmanship Pandora cannot replicate at scale. Pandora has no easy upward path once it abandons its real metal identity. **13) Collabs are at risk: Disney is not guaranteed forever** Pandora has relied heavily on collaborations. Disney (major), Bridgerton (recent), and other branded tie-ins. If Pandora’s perceived quality collapses, those partner brands may reassess whether they want their IP associated with cheap plated jewellery. Disney already sells down-market costume jewellery. Pandora was attractive because it was above that tier. If Pandora becomes indistinguishable from lower market costume products, Disney can demand better terms, reduce partnership intensity, or walk entirely. Losing Disney would be catastrophic because Disney products are a meaningful share of Pandora’s demand engine. **14) The core problem: Pandora cannot detach itself from materials like true luxury can** In high jewellery, brands can charge massive premiums over metal value because they have centuries of heritage, design leadership, cultural prestige, craftsmanship narratives, and scarcity. Pandora has none of those moats. Pandora’s moat is scale, distribution, and real metal at accessible prices. If Pandora removes the real metal component, they are betting that their logo alone can support premium pricing. That is a luxury fashion assumption. And it is wrong. Even in luxury jewellery and fashion, materials still matter. Construction quality still matters. People still care about what they are actually buying. In high jewellery, materials matter even more than brand in the vast majority of cases. A Cartier necklace still needs to be gold. A Van Cleef piece still needs to be constructed properly. A Boucheron client still cares about stone quality. Pandora seems to be forgetting that jewellery is not champagne. Jewellery is not a t-shirt. Jewellery is not perfume. You cannot strip out the material value and expect the brand to survive unchanged. **Conclusion: This is not margin management, it is a value-destructive decision** Pandora switching from sterling silver to platinum-plated alloy is like a premium denim brand switching from real denim to polyester to protect margins. The spreadsheet looks better short term. The brand is structurally impaired long term. Pandora is not moving into a new innovative category. They are voluntarily stepping down into costume jewellery, a market that is smaller ($31 to $45B), brutally commoditised, structurally dominated by fashion houses and OEM mass production, and historically a graveyard for mid-tier premium brands. And they are doing it with the worst possible product format (daily-wear charm bracelets and rings), guaranteeing that plating failure becomes a consumer meme. Once the meme exists, Pandora’s pricing power collapses. Once pricing power collapses, Pandora is forced down-market. Once Pandora is down-market, it is fighting Shein and OEM factories. And that is not a business model. That is slow liquidation disguised as strategy. If shareholders are rational, they should fight this decision aggressively before Pandora permanently destroys the one thing that made the company valuable. Its position as the world’s default real jewellery for normal people. This is irreversible brand damage. **TL;DR:** Pandora switching from sterling silver to platinum-plated alloy is not a harmless cost-saving move. It is a structural downgrade that destroys the material value floor and “real jewellery” perception that underpins their pricing power. Because Pandora is daily-wear jewellery (bracelets, rings), plating wear and tarnish complaints will explode, damaging brand equity and forcing them down-market into a commoditised costume jewellery segment where they will be crushed by OEM imports and cheaper competitors. Swarovski works because it has a distinct crystal identity and reinvention narrative. Pandora’s move reads as cost-cutting and downgrade, not reinvention. If I were a shareholder, I would actively campaign against this decision. **(P.S.

Starlink Dominance: SpaceX’s cost of launch is unbeatable. If Starlink pivots aggressively to enterprise, OneWeb’s margins could be crushed. 2. Dilution: The recent rights issues have hammered the share price. Investors are wary of any further \"cash calls.\" 3. GEO Decline: The legacy video business is shrinking faster than expected, eating away the cash flow needed to fund the LEO expansion. 🟢 The Bull Case: 1. Undervalued Assets: The stock trades at a deep discount to its intrinsic value (some estimates suggest >70% undervalued). 2. Sovereign Play: Europe needs its own satellite constellation. Eutelsat is the \"National Champion.\" Government contracts are sticky and high-margin. 3. Short Squeeze/Mean Reversion: The stock has been heavily shorted/sold off. A \"boring\" earnings report with confirmed guidance could spark a massive relief rally. **🏁 Final Verdict: The \"Binary Play\"** Eutelsat is currently a high-risk, high-reward turnaround play. If they hit their 50% LEO growth target on February 13th and show that the debt is under control, the current €2.20 range will look like a steal in retrospect.", "score": 0, "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1qz7msh/etl_dd_eutelsat_communications_the_phoenix_of/", "post_url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1qz7msh/etl_dd_eutelsat_communications_the_phoenix_of/"}

Many people have offered their bullish and bearish opinions but very few are rooting their claims in quantifiable facts. I am delving into the numbers in detail in order to truly verify the fair value of Reddit. To cut through the noise, I am getting the fair value by projecting out to 2030, estimating the revenue of each geographical segment. Based on the estimation below, I categorise Reddit’s fair value into 4 possible outcomes:l # FAIR VALUE PRICE TARGETS * **Ultra Bull Case (Max Limit, Very Very Unlikely): $638.22** * **Very Optimistic Reasonable Case (Unlikely): $294.95** * **Reasonable Case: $183.88** * **Bear Case: $96.09** Feel free to go through the step by step analysis below and provide feedbacks. # FAIR VALUE CALCULATION (DECEMBER 2030 Projections) Below represents the detailed breakdown of US, EU, and ROW (Rest of World) metrics for each scenario, discounted back to January 2026. |Metric|Bear Case|Reasonable Case|Very Optimistic|Ultra Bull| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |**--- US SEGMENT ---**||||| |US DAU|60M|60M|60M|60M| |US ARPU|$62|$102|$156|$312| |US Revenue|$3.70B|$6.12B|$9.36B|$18.72B| |||||| |**--- EU SEGMENT ---**||||| |EU DAU|30M|30M|30M|30M| |EU ARPU|$25|$40|$62|$124| |EU Revenue|$0.74B|$1.20B|$1.86B|$3.72B| |||||| |**--- ROW SEGMENT ---**||||| |ROW DAU|70M|70M|70M|70M| |ROW ARPU|$5|$8|$12|$25| |ROW Revenue|$0.35B|$0.56B|$0.87B|$1.75B| |||||| |**--- VALUATION ---**||||| |Total Revenue as of 2030|$4.83B|$7.88B|$12.00B|$24.19B| |5 year CAGR Growth (2025 - 2030)|17.0%|29.0%|40.4%|61.5%| |Net Margins|30%|30%|30%|30%| |Total Profit as as of 2030|$1.45B|$2.36B|$3.60B|$7.20B| |PE Ratio|18x|23x|25x|28x| |2030 Market Cap|$26.1B|$54.28B|$90.0B|$201.0B| |**Jan 2026 Mkt Cap (PV)**|**$17.76B**|**$36.94B**|**$61.25B**|**$136.80B**| |**PV of Cumulative FCF + Net Cash** |**$4.11B**|**$4.91B**|**$5.88B**|**$8.46B**| |**Fair Value per Share**|**$96.09**|**$183.88**|**$294.95**|**$638.22**| # ASSUMPTIONS **Outstanding shares** Based on fully diluted outstanding shares of 206.1 million (as of 2025) multiplied by a share dilution rate of 2% a year until 2030 (Management guided between 1% to 3%), which gives us 227.6 million outstanding shares by 2030. **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)** ARPU is based on Ceiling ARPU. Ceiling ARPU is the theoretical maximum ARPU Reddit can reach. It is based on META’s estimated 2025 ARPU. The rationale for this is that Reddit is very unlikely to exceed META’s ARPU, given META’s unrivalled ad tech stack. Since META stop disclosing geographical ARPU after 2023, we simply multiply 2023 ARPU by 1.2x, as META has grown revenue since, to get META 2025 ARPU. ***Reddit’s ARPU assumption per scenario:*** * **Ultra Bull Case ARPU** = META Full 2025 ARPU. This is very very unlikely as Reddit can never replicate META’s ad tech stack within a short 5 years, and may never will. * Very optimistic Reasonable Case = 50% \\* META 2025 ARPU. Twitter’s ARPU back in 2022 was half that of META’s. BUT it was an even higher percentage before 2022, but it stagnated and META continued to grow. Because ARPU is not guaranteed to keep growing without a really good ad tech stack, I consider this scenario to be very optimistic, and unlikely. * **Reasonable Case** = 33% \\* META 2025 ARPU. I consider a third of META’s ARPU to be reasonable. So far, Reddit manages to achieve strong ARPU growth but this is also due to a low base effect. Twitter or Snapchat also recorded rapid ARPU growth in their early stage but saturated and stagnated after a period of time. This tells us that without a proven ad tech stack, we wont really know if Reddit can achieve continuous ARPU growth like the Tier 1 players, Google and META. I m also listing down reasons why I think Reddit ARPU will remain below that of META. * **Bear Case** = 20% x META 2025 ARPU. Reddit can no longer improve its ad conversion performance. ***Reasons why I think Reddit ARPU will remain below that of META:*** The negative reasons: 1. Reddit is text based scrolling, which is not that good for ads. 2. Reddit users has lower engagement duration compared to META users. 3. Reddit is anonymous, and has inherently inferior ad targeting capabilities. 4. Reddit users in ROW is fragmented, with multiple tiny local communities in each country, this makes it hard for ROW local advertisers to justify buying Reddit ads. I live in a Non-Western country with one of the biggest non-Western Reddit community, I have never seen a local AD. Whereas META and Google have tonnes of it. 5. Reddit users are anti Ads, takes a lot of experiment to get it right, dissuading advertisers. The positive reasons: 1. Reddit allows niche targeting and interest-based targeting according the subs theme. 2. Reddit has a sizable user base that do not overlap with other social media platforms (30% to 70%, spending on which platform). To target these people, advertisers must advertise on Reddit. **DAU** End-2025 DAU: **US:** 52.5 million **EU** (estimated): 24.3 million **ROW:** 44.6 million Total DAU: 121.4 million Reddit does not disclose EU DAU. The DAU is estimated from the 2024 data by WorldPopulationReview who collated data from Statista and Semrush. The data shows around 25% are from EU. However, I m just assuming 20% as ROW is growing faster than EU and US in 2025. **DAU growth** The reason I m not changing forecasted DAU for each scenario is because the DAU growth potential is pretty much fixed. The most important number is US DAU, EU and ROW DAU will not move the needle much. We know that US DAU is stagnating as Reddit appeals to a much smaller base of customers. **Price to Earnings (PE)** I consider the PE assigned to the stock to be highly intertwined with ARPU performance, which is in turn highly intertwined with Ad Conversion Performance. If Reddit can’t keep improving its ad conversion performance, it can’t grow ARPU fast, and it does not deserve a high valuation. META’s PE has average at around 25 since 2017, despite consistently growing earnings by 25%+ a year, reflecting a PEG ratio of 1, meaning PE 25 is indeed the fair value for META. As such, the future growth rate will determine the acceptable PE. * **Ultra Bull Case** * Historical 5 years CAGR: 61.5% * Future 5 years CAGR: 30% * Assigned PE: 28 * **Very Optimistic Bull Case** * Historical 5 years CAGR: 40.3% * Future 5 years CAGR: 25% * Assigned PE: 25 * **Reasonable Case** * Historical 5 years CAGR: 29% * Future 5 years CAGR: 18% * Assigned PE: 23 (Note: PE should be higher than growth because Reddit is a high ROIC business; 20 is too low for a capital light business that is growing at more than 15% a year). * **Bear Case** * Historical 5 years CAGR: 17% * Future 5 years CAGR: 10% * Assigned PE: 18 (Note: 15 is too low for a capital light business that is growing at more than 8% a year). **Present Value Discount Rate** We use 8% as the discount rate. **Present Value of Cumulative FCF** We assume a reinvestment rate of 50% from 2026 to 2030. That leaves the other 50% of FCF that can potentially goes into share buybacks, which amounts to the cumulative FCF in the table. **Net Margins** We should assume industry average net margins, \\~30%. While Reddit has shown it can deliver higher margins, it also has a strong affinity for share based compensation and I believe it is only healthy to spend on things like R&D and marketing expenses. Additionally, Q42025 net profit margin excludes income tax because it is benefitting from carry forward tax benefits. US tax is 21%. # FACTORS LEFT OUT OF THE FAIR VALUE CALCULATION FOR SIMPLICITY SAKE Factors leading to underestimation (upside risk) 1. **Growth in Ceiling ARPU.** This analysis assumes the ceiling ARPU stays stagnant from 2026 to 2030, despite the continued growth of online ad market. We could have underestimated the ceiling ARPU by 2030. 2. **Additional levers of DAU growth.** I am projecting stagnant US DAU because Reddit has already saturated the US market. However, Reddit can overcome saturation with two more levers of DAU growth: First, converting logged out users to logged in users, Second, converting MAU to DAU. 3. **Outstanding shares based on 2030.** I have calculated 2025 Fair Value per share by dividing discounted market cap by outstanding shares expected as of 2030. The reason for this is it is difficult to factor in the exact impact of the dilution in our current valuation framework. Factors leading to overestimation (downside risk) 1. **Share dilution risk.** I think this is a big risk. I really do not understand what’s the management’s intention on this. They mentioned keep dilution rate per year at 1% to 3%. But that could mean a lot of things. Example, they can dilute the share base by 5% and then buy back 2% using FCF, resulting in 3% dilution. They also have a very big multi year share compensation package in 2024, this concerns me a lot as it may repeat in the future. 2. **Limited English Speakers outside US, Europe and India.** This means Reddit has a lower Total Addressable Market. I also note that most countries have their own internet forums that are entrenched in their respective societies. 3. **There is no certainty that Reddit can keep improving its ad conversion performance.** If Reddit fails to do that, stock will significantly rerate downwards. 4. **Net profit margin too optimistic.** I think this is a big risk. Q42025 net profit margin is 35%. However, on a normalized tax basis, meaning without the carryforward tax loss benefits, its Q42025 net profit margins is actually 28%. Additionally, it is hard to achieve significant growth without really high R&D expenses. But I m too lazy to deal with it, so I m putting profit margin at 30%. I believe Redditors will also strongly disagree that I put it any lower. Personally, I would assume a lower net profit margin. #", "text": "Enough with the opinions.

AI infra is basically just an energy game now and France’s nuclear baseload is a massive unfair advantage compared to the grid struggles we’re seeing in the States. Macron's 2030 plan is clearly working, and with over €100B in private commitments, they’re basically building the physical floor for the next decade of compute. ​Is this a legit macro pivot or am I overthinking the delta here? I’m curious if anyone is actually looking at EU utility or infra stocks because this capital flow seems too big to ignore.

I know. \\- Along with having a clear controlled mind, have a game plan and STICK to it. More often than not you had the right idea and you should see it through.

And if they don't then money isn't gonna help where we're all going! \\- It bears repeating to never be fully invested. Never be fully leveraged. Temper your exuberance during the good times so you can add on during the low times. \\- The hardest thing is selling during a bull market and buying during a bear market. Successful traders and the \"big boys\" do this successfully. Retail does not. \\- I hate the term time in market but damn it it's true. But if you're buying quality stocks when the market turns down you will be rewarded eventually. \\- If you aren't buying and you aren't selling then turn it off.

Carvana also came under fire last month after a short seller report by Gotham City Capital questioning their sub-prime lending and accounting practices. Now CVNA has given off a strongly Bearish technical signal as it's 20 day EMA crossed its 50 day SMA in what is often called a \"Bear Cross\" or a \"Death Cross.\" (Can I say that here? Do I have to write Unalive Cross?) I am the first to admit that technical analysis is about as accurate as tarot readings or Voodoo magic. However, the last 2 times CVNA's moving averages crossed like they did today the stock fell dramatically over the coming weeks. In March of 2025 CVNA went through a Bear Cross and fell from $220 to $162. In October 2025 CVNA fell from $357 to $285 after a Bear Cross. As of 4pm today (2/5/2026) CVNA traded at a lofty $383 a share, a significant drop off from their $490 peak after inclusion in the S&P500, but still a staggering 78 times their reported annual income. Between geopolitical turmoil, risk-off selling, the recent short seller report, and now this clearly bearish technical signal, it seems highly likely CVNA will continue their precipitous fall. As I have posted before, I have current open put option positions against CVNA and intend to continue to short CVNA stock for the immediate future. I may open or close other positions with no prior notice. Year to date this short trade is up over 34%, and I have no intention of letting off CVNA until their market cap approaches a more appropriate enterprise value. I am not a Financial Advisor.

(NYSE: SNAP) has experienced significant volatility over the past several years, currently trading in the mid-single to low-double digit range depending on market sentiment and earnings cycles. The stock remains well below its historical highs, reflecting broader pressure across digital advertising platforms as well as company-specific challenges related to user monetization and competition. Snap originally gained traction as a fast-growing social media platform built around ephemeral messaging, augmented reality features, and a strong appeal among younger demographics. At its peak growth stage, the company benefited from rapid user adoption and increasing advertiser demand for mobile-focused engagement tools. However, the digital advertising landscape has changed significantly over the last few years, creating both structural and cyclical challenges for Snap’s business model. From a financial perspective, Snap has experienced periods of slowing revenue growth. Recent earnings reports have shown quarterly revenue growth that has moderated compared to earlier expansion phases. Advertising remains the company’s primary revenue driver, and fluctuations in advertiser spending have had a direct impact on top-line performance. Macroeconomic uncertainty has also influenced advertising budgets across multiple industries, creating additional volatility in Snap’s revenue trends. User growth has remained relatively stable, with Snap continuing to report strong daily active user engagement, particularly among Gen Z demographics. However, investor concerns increasingly focus on monetization efficiency rather than raw user growth. Average revenue per user has faced pressure as advertisers evaluate return on investment and shift budgets between competing platforms such as Meta, TikTok, and emerging social video ecosystems. On the cost side, Snap has implemented multiple restructuring initiatives aimed at improving operating efficiency. Over the past two years, the company reduced workforce size and consolidated several internal product divisions. Management has emphasized streamlining product development while prioritizing core revenue-generating features. These cost reduction measures have improved operating discipline but have not fully offset revenue growth concerns. Snap has continued to invest heavily in augmented reality and artificial intelligence capabilities as long-term differentiation strategies. The company’s AR lens ecosystem and creator tools remain among the most advanced within social media platforms. Snap has positioned these tools as future monetization channels through branded AR advertising, creator partnerships, and interactive commerce experiences. While these technologies offer long-term potential, near-term revenue contribution remains uncertain and dependent on advertiser adoption. Competitive pressure remains one of Snap’s most significant strategic challenges. Larger platforms with broader user ecosystems benefit from scale advantages in advertising analytics, targeting infrastructure, and cross-platform engagement. TikTok’s rapid expansion in short-form video and Meta’s continued investment in AI-driven ad targeting have intensified competition for user attention and advertiser budgets. From a trading standpoint, SNAP has demonstrated elevated volatility around earnings announcements, macro advertising trends, and broader technology sector sentiment. Technical patterns have shown repeated testing of support levels during weaker advertising cycles, followed by sharp rallies during periods of improved guidance or stronger user engagement metrics. Trading volume often increases significantly during earnings releases, indicating strong institutional and retail participation. Long-term strategic outlook for Snap largely depends on the company’s ability to improve advertising monetization while maintaining strong user engagement among younger demographics. The platform’s brand identity and cultural relevance remain valuable intangible assets. Additionally, Snap’s early leadership in AR technology may provide strategic optionality if immersive digital advertising and social commerce adoption accelerate over time. However, several risk factors remain. Advertising spending remains highly cyclical and sensitive to economic conditions. Competition for digital advertising share continues to intensify across social media platforms. Additionally, continued investment in emerging technologies requires balancing long-term innovation with near-term profitability expectations. From a valuation perspective, SNAP often trades based on forward growth expectations rather than current profitability metrics. This dynamic contributes to higher volatility relative to more mature advertising platforms. Investor sentiment tends to shift rapidly based on revenue growth trajectories and management guidance regarding advertiser demand. Overall, Snap represents a technology platform transitioning from early hyper-growth toward a more mature monetization and efficiency-focused phase. The company retains strong brand recognition and technological differentiation in augmented reality, but its ability to translate engagement into sustainable advertising revenue remains the central investment debate. Not financial advice. This summary is based on publicly available filings, earnings reports, and industry analysis. Do you think Snap can improve advertising monetization while maintaining user engagement, or will competitive pressure continue to limit long-term growth potential?", "text": "SNAP faces slowing advertising growth despite product innovation and cost restructuring Snap Inc. (NYSE: SNAP) has experienced significant volatility over the past several years, currently trading in the mid-single to low-double digit range depending on market sentiment and earnings cycles. The stock remains well below its historical highs, reflecting broader pressure across digital advertising platforms as well as company-specific challenges related to user monetization and competition. Snap originally gained traction as a fast-growing social media platform built around ephemeral messaging, augmented reality features, and a strong appeal among younger demographics. At its peak growth stage, the company benefited from rapid user adoption and increasing advertiser demand for mobile-focused engagement tools. However, the digital advertising landscape has changed significantly over the last few years, creating both structural and cyclical challenges for Snap’s business model. From a financial perspective, Snap has experienced periods of slowing revenue growth. Recent earnings reports have shown quarterly revenue growth that has moderated compared to earlier expansion phases. Advertising remains the company’s primary revenue driver, and fluctuations in advertiser spending have had a direct impact on top-line performance. Macroeconomic uncertainty has also influenced advertising budgets across multiple industries, creating additional volatility in Snap’s revenue trends. User growth has remained relatively stable, with Snap continuing to report strong daily active user engagement, particularly among Gen Z demographics.

We can take away a couple things. 1) reddit sentiment weakens so fast after a couple of red weeks; clearly most retail investors dont have high conviction or do proper diligence. 2) Redditors fail to follow a buying plan, if they had one to begin with, when their favorite stock dips 20-30%. Institutions on the other hand, force selling action on retailers, then buy at their planned price! That’s why they win out. I for one, am buying the stocks I have high conviction on during this dip.

Might be in for a quick redemption from yesterday’s PYPL bloodbath.", "score": 8, "num_comments": 96, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1qvi9zf/i_bought_40000_snap_shares_at_6_and_will_hold/", "post_url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1qvi9zf/i_bought_40000_snap_shares_at_6_and_will_hold/"}

FY25 revenue: $753M (up 56% YoY) Adjusted EBITDA: $169M (22.5% margin) Adjusted net income: $88.7M Backlog: $1.03B as of Sept 2025 Q1 FY26 came in at $283M revenue which is 84% growth. The backlog being larger than full year revenue gives decent visibility. One thing I noticed - they lead with adjusted figures everywhere. GAAP net income isn't prominently disclosed which usually means there's a meaningful gap. They're adjusting out amortization from acquisitions, sponsor fees, integration costs, stock comp, etc. The adjustments are defensible given the situation but I'd like to see full GAAP figures.

Neos Partners bought four separate companies between Oct 2023 and June 2024: MGM Transformer (Oct 2023) PwrQ (March 2024) States Manufacturing (May 2024) VanTran (June 2024) So they've been operating as a combined entity for less than two years.

Pros: * AI buildout, grid modernization, manufacturing reshoring - all of this requires electrical equipment * Supply constrained market. Lead times for this stuff can be 2-4 years from some suppliers. Forgent claims their lead times are 30-65% shorter than industry average * Capacity expansion almost done. They've invested $205M to expand manufacturing, should support up to $5B in revenue without major additional capex * Management knows the space Cons: * This is a PE exit. 70% of the IPO is secondary (existing shareholders cashing out). Only 30% is primary shares with proceeds going to the company. Neos wants liquidity. * Roll-up risk. Four acquisitions in 8 months is aggressive and its unproven as a combined entity.

Let‘s skip ahead and talk about the things they are doing right: They are outfitted with the right people with correct tone for making their case to regulatory bodies. They don’t speak like innovators. They’re speaking like bankers. Lawmakers like that. It’s dry, boring and (somewhat) comprehensible. They’re also making the right arguments to the current regime: ”We support dollar dominance globally by offering a platform denominated in the USD stablecoin and subsequent staking rewards” and “We are an American-born company on the leading edge of blockchain‘s global adoption”. That’s also language that remains party neutral, a durable good, if you will. As for their revenue mission, they’re the infrastructure for institutional involvement in crypto. Their next evolution is already happening as they strive to be the base for efficient rules-based exchange. This can encompass so many things…contracts, ownership stakes, pay arrangements, record keeping, KYC; all of which have highly universal applications. This isn’t a huge revenue bump felt immediately but an accumulation that will make their revenue stickier and more predictable with time. A few other revenue streams worth noting that are within reach: compliance and authorization as a service, prime brokerage services, merchant/stablecoin infrastructure and processing, treasury services, tokenized private investments (funds, LP models, DPPs), international exchange developments that programmatically adopt the host-nations regulatory framework. None of these areas are a stretch, but I also want to leave a disclaimer that none of them would massively drive revenue growth in a single year.

The Kospi, which had plummeted over 5% the previous day and fell below the 5,000-point mark, surged over 6% on the 3rd, setting a record high based on the closing price. On that day, the Kospi closed at 5,288.08, up 6.84% (338.41 points) from the previous day. The increase exceeded the previous day’s decline of 274.69 points. The day’s gain was the largest since March 24, 2020 (8.6%), during the height of the 'Donghak Ant Movement'. Institutions and foreigners led the index rebound by net buying approximately 2 trillion Korean won and 700 billion Korean won, respectively. Individuals net sold nearly 3 trillion Korean won.

The Kospi, which had plummeted over 5% the previous day and fell below the 5,000-point mark, surged over 6% on the 3rd, setting a record high based on the closing price. On that day, the Kospi closed at 5,288.08, up 6.84% (338.41 points) from the previous day. The increase exceeded the previous day’s decline of 274.69 points. The day’s gain was the largest since March 24, 2020 (8.6%), during the height of the 'Donghak Ant Movement'. Institutions and foreigners led the index rebound by net buying approximately 2 trillion Korean won and 700 billion Korean won, respectively. Individuals net sold nearly 3 trillion Korean won.

It feels like such a façade seeing the stock market rise so heavily in hearing that economy is doing so well when I feel like most of the Americans, I speak to believe that their lives have been getting worse. Interesting article to read but PE ratio for the SP500 is at roughly 40 which was the similar PE when the stock market corrected in the dot com bubble and 2008. That’s why companies like Microsoft got punished, even though they beat expectations. Time to sell and keep cash, I have a bad feeling about this $7000. The stakes, in short, are high for bulls to eclipse the 7,000 psychological hurdle, and then hold it. The last time we tested 7,000 was Jan. 28, and markets quickly retrenched.

Firstly it is a conspiracy that Amazon will treat them differently even if they are a competitor, it’s completely unfounded but a still reasonable consideration.

The company plans to issue equity from the at-the-market program flexibly over time at prevailing market prices, based on market conditions and capital needs. On the debt side, Oracle intends to complete a single, one-time issuance of investment-grade senior unsecured bonds early in 2026 to cover the other half of the company's planned funding for the year. Oracle does not expect to issue additional bonds during calendar year 2026 beyond this transaction. This funding plan reflects Oracle's commitment to maintaining an investment-grade rating, prudent capital allocation, balance sheet strength, and transparency with investors as the company continues to expand its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure business.

And the meme of things always being priced in comes from the Efficient Market Hypothesis, which is an academic theory adjacent to Modern Portfolio Theory, which itself has been bastardized and misappropriated by many “investors” online. So here’s a quick rundown on it from someone who actually knows what it is, what it’s used for, and why it does not mean you can’t be a successful active retail trader. EMH argues that asset prices reflect all available info. There are three forms of EMH: strong, semi-strong, weak. Weak form argues that technical analysis is useless. This is somewhat true IMO, but support/resistance, volume spikes, relative strength, and moving averages are useful. Semi-strong form argues that fundamental analysis is useless, which is just blatantly untrue. The market is often slow to react and there are God knows how many examples of people catching things early. I’ve done, you’ve done it, and institutions certainly have done it. Strong form argues that insider trading is useless and I don’t even think I need to expand on how untrue that is. Now, does that mean I’m dismissing EMH and its creator as stupid? Of course not. EMH was created by Eugene Fama, and his name speaks for itself. Among his many accomplishments, he created the Fama-French model, which has also been bastardized by “investors” who go on and on about factor tilts and diversifying just to end up investing in VT. EMH is like rational choice theory in Econ 101: it’s a baseline framework under which you teach students the foundations, before you teach them (or they learn themselves) that real life is messy. EMH assumes that investors are all rational wealth maximizing machines, that irrational behavior is totally random, and that if a price does get irrational, smart money immediately steps in to move it back to where it should be. In reality, none of this is true. If this were true, we never would have had 2008 or even minor corrections like 2022. It also assumes that there are no asymmetries in access to information, and that trading is frictionless - no costs, no tax, and instant. Bottom line: yes it’s hard to beat the market. You won’t beat it by blindly trading trending tickers. EMH explains why markets are hard to beat.

Among his many accomplishments, he created the Fama-French model, which has also been bastardized by “investors” who go on and on about factor tilts and diversifying just to end up investing in VT. EMH is like rational choice theory in Econ 101: it’s a baseline framework under which you teach students the foundations, before you teach them (or they learn themselves) that real life is messy. EMH assumes that investors are all rational wealth maximizing machines, that irrational behavior is totally random, and that if a price does get irrational, smart money immediately steps in to move it back to where it should be. In reality, none of this is true. If this were true, we never would have had 2008 or even minor corrections like 2022. It also assumes that there are no asymmetries in access to information, and that trading is frictionless - no costs, no tax, and instant. Bottom line: yes it’s hard to beat the market. You won’t beat it by blindly trading trending tickers. EMH explains why markets are hard to beat. But it’s a classroom model, not real life.", "score": 6, "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1qs9qg8/here_is_why_its_not_always_priced_in_emh_is/", "post_url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1qs9qg8/here_is_why_its_not_always_priced_in_emh_is/"}

A T-bill (short-term), T-note and bond (long term) sell off by the Ministry of Finance would cause diplomatic rows, and send US Bond yields soaring, sparking a severe risk of US economic collapse, particular in longer term treasuries.
