They're **systematically extracting equity from every serious AI company while getting their money back through infrastructure fees.** **Here's how it works:** 1. AI startup needs $1 billion to train models (can't afford it) 2. Amazon \"invests\" $1 billion for equity stake 3. Startup immediately pays $1 billion back to Amazon for AWS cloud services 4. Amazon gets its money back, keeps the equity forever **Cost basis: Zero.** Rinse and repeat across every AI company that wants to scale. **The result:** * Amazon, Microsoft, Google collectively own 34-45% of every major AI company * They get all their invested capital back through infrastructure fees * They're building a portfolio of ownership across the entire industry **This isn't about picking winners. They own pieces of everyone.** # Why This Won't Be Regulated Each company takes minority stakes to avoid majority control scrutiny. They can all claim they're \"competing\" with each other. To actually stop this, regulators would need to take all three companies to court together and prove coordinated behavior. That's unprecedented. By the time regulators figure this out (5-10 years), the value has already been extracted. The equity stakes are locked in. The infrastructure dependencies are embedded. # PART 2: THE ANTHROPIC PROOF Let me show you this isn't theory. Here are the actual numbers from Anthropic (current valuation: $380 billion): **Who owns it:** * Amazon: 15-21% (worth $57-79.8 billion) * Google: 14% (worth $53.2 billion) * Microsoft: \\~5-10% (worth $19-38 billion) * **Total hyperscaler ownership: 34-45%** **What they paid:** * Amazon: $8 billion * Google: $3.75 billion * Microsoft: $10-15 billion * **Total invested: \\~$25 billion** **What they're getting back in infrastructure fees:** * Anthropic committed to spend $75-105+ billion on AWS, GCP, and Azure * Amazon getting $5+ billion/year (gets investment back in <2 years) * Google getting $10-15 billion/year (gets investment back in months) **The extraction:** * Invested: $25 billion * Getting back in fees: $75-105 billion * Keeping in equity: $129-171 billion * **Total value extracted: $204-276 billion from a single company** **And this same pattern is happening with:** * OpenAI (Microsoft owns \\~27%) * Every other AI startup at scale # PART 3: WHY \"CIRCULAR FINANCING\" COMPLETELY MISSES THE POINT **I know what you're thinking:** \"This is just like Cisco in the 1990s doing vendor financing.\" **Wrong. Here's why:** # Cisco Gave Loans. The Hyperscalers Buy Equity. **Cisco (1990s):** * Extended credit/loans to buy equipment * Held debt (IOUs) - companies owed them money * Got ZERO equity. No stock. No ownership. * Dot-com burst → Companies defaulted → Cisco lost billions * Stock dropped 86% **Amazon/Microsoft/Google (now):** * BUY EQUITY STAKES - become shareholders (15-49% ownership) * Get money back through infrastructure fees * KEEP the stock forever * If AI company fails: Already got money back, equity was free * If AI company succeeds: Got money back + own billions in stock **Cisco was a creditor. Hyperscalers are shareholders.** Completely different financial instruments. Completely different outcomes. # Cisco Lent to the Wrong Companies **Cisco financed:** * Telecom companies, ISPs, fiber optic builders (WorldCom, Global Crossing) * Infrastructure builders, not platform winners **Cisco got ZERO equity in:** * Google, Amazon, Facebook, eBay, Netflix * The actual winners of the internet **Amazon/Microsoft/Google own:** * Anthropic (could replace Google Search) * OpenAI (could replace Microsoft Office) * Every AI startup that could disrupt them **The potential disruptors are owned by the incumbents.** # The Internet Was Cheap. AI Is Expensive. **Starting a web company (1990s):** $50,000-$100,000 * Google started in a garage * Facebook in a dorm room * Infrastructure costs were negligible **Building frontier AI (now):** $100M-$1B to train, $5-15B/year to run * Cannot build in a garage * No cheap alternative at scale * Only 3 companies can provide infrastructure **When infrastructure cost $50K, Cisco couldn't extract equity.** **When infrastructure costs $5 billion/year, hyperscalers extract whatever they want.** **The cost barrier IS the control mechanism.** **QUICK NOTE ON THE CHINA THREAT:** **People ask: \"What about China/DeepSeek commoditizing AI?\"** * **US government won't allow Chinese AI into American market - national security threat, regulatory barriers (see: TikTok)** * **No Western company will store data on Chinese cloud - espionage risk, compliance issues, trust deficit** * **China's AI-capable data centers are 1/8th the size of US infrastructure - and the gap is widening ($98B vs $385B annual spending)** * **DeepSeek's efficiency gains are overstated - claimed $294K training, actual cost \\~$6M+ when including base model, total infrastructure $500M-$1.3B** * **Efficiency doesn't eliminate infrastructure dependency - even cheaper training still requires massive deployment infrastructure controlled by AWS/Azure/GCP** **Full China analysis coming to my Substack next week.** # THE BOTTOM LINE This isn't the dot-com bubble.

Ships keep flowing, rates stay high, and the geopolitical noise supports a risk premium without actually breaking the trade routes. I think the bear case is: 1. Shadow fleet oversupply Kpler warns that shadow fleet VLCCs are now sitting idle after Venezuela was removed from sanctioned trade. If these ships re-enter the commercial market, rate pressure follows. 2. OPEC+ resuming cuts unwind in April more supply could mean more tanker demand, but could also mean lower oil prices which dampens sentiment.

The exercises are at sea operation, not ground mobilization Neither side has built new shelters, staged equipment, or altered base infrastructure The dual carrier deployment is a naval posture not reflected in ground changes The oil \"war premium\" in crude is probably overstated Elevated tanker traffic + no actual disruption = the best setup for tanker stocks. Ships keep flowing, rates stay high, and the geopolitical noise supports a risk premium without actually breaking the trade routes. I think the bear case is: 1. Shadow fleet oversupply Kpler warns that shadow fleet VLCCs are now sitting idle after Venezuela was removed from sanctioned trade. If these ships re-enter the commercial market, rate pressure follows. 2. OPEC+ resuming cuts unwind in April more supply could mean more tanker demand, but could also mean lower oil prices which dampens sentiment.

Figured I’d post the risk map because the bull and bear takes I keep seeing here miss the same thing. People argue HIMS like it’s one company. It’s two. Business A is the cash pay subscription platform: hair, ED, derm, mental health. Recurring revenue, no insurance friction. That engine is real and I’m not here to dunk on it. Business B was the GLP1 compounding era. A national funnel built around a regulatory perimeter that was never meant for mass market distribution. That perimeter tightened, the stock got repriced, and now the whole debate is whether they can unwind that exposure without snapping the core. Before governance, before narrative, the thing that matters is unit economics. Subscriber growth isn’t the flex people think it is if the economics under each subscriber drift the wrong way. You don’t need subs to collapse to get a nasty rerate. You just need the platform to get more expensive to grow. From what’s been publicly reported: non GLP ARPU went from roughly $60 to $55 in a single quarter, Q2 2025. Blended ARPU fell from roughly $84 to $74 over the same window. Marketing was about $218M in Q2 2025 against roughly 73,000 net new subs, which is about $3,000 per marginal add. Gross margin went from roughly 82% in FY2023 to roughly 74% by Q3 2025. Mix and fulfillment complexity doing what they always do to high margin platform narratives. None of that means the company’s dead. It just means the bull case has to be tighter than they have 2.5M subscribers. The real argument is: they can still acquire and retain profitably in a post headline world. If you can’t make that case, everything else is vibes. Now, the 88% lockout. HIMS is effectively controlled by the CEO through a dual class structure. Class A gets one vote. Class V gets 175 votes. Roughly 88% of total voting power sits with the CEO group. He also holds Chairman and committee seats, which narrows internal friction exactly when friction is supposed to protect you as a shareholder. This doesn’t make him evil. It just means outcomes get more binary. When it works, it’s fast. When it doesn’t, there’s no one to pull the brake. You’re underwriting one person’s judgment whether you want to or not. Regulatory and legal. This is where comment sections go stupid, so I’ll keep it tight. This isn’t compounding is illegal now. Patient specific compounding in narrow lawful use cases is a completely different universe from a nationwide, ad driven, subscription checkout GLP1 funnel. The risk sits in the gap between compounding as a clinical exception and compounding as a scaled consumer product. Once enforcement shifts toward copycat framing, the business model gets targeted, not just the drug category. Even if you think they keep some version of weight loss revenue, the question is whether they keep the scaled version that actually moved the needle. And litigation doesn’t need a court loss to hurt you. The process is a tax: fees, distraction, settlement leverage that never fully goes away. Translation: they may keep offering weight loss solutions. The risky part is the national funnel built on a regulatory edge. Okay. The math people keep dodging: the 2030 converts. About $1B in zero coupon convertible notes due May 2030. Conversion price $70.67. Stock’s around $16. Those notes behave like cash debt, not equity dilution. Base case: they’ve reported about $1.1B cash and roughly $300M a year free cash flow. Four years of that is about $1.2B. Add the cash and you’re around $2.3B of firepower against $1B due. That can work. Downside case, the one that actually matters: if GLP1 unwinds fast and free cash flow drops to $100M to $150M a year, four years gives you $400M to $600M. Starting cash $1.1B plus that generation equals $1.5B to $1.7B. Pay the notes and you’re left with $0.5B to $0.7B for everything. Ops, marketing, legal drain. Not bankruptcy. But it turns into a refinancing and capital allocation story that gets louder every quarter the GLP1 line deteriorates. The notes don’t care what you call the pivot. They care whether the cash shows up. Where I land: neutral. HIMS can survive if the GLP1 transition happens in an orderly way and subscriber economics stabilize. If revenue drops faster than management can replace it while legal pressure escalates, this flips from a growth story to a balance sheet story before 2030. What would change my mind: GLP1 exposure declining without a cliff, non GLP unit economics stabilizing, and legal and regulatory outcomes staying bounded. If you want my quick framing: best case, the GLP1 line shrinks gracefully or transitions to compliant alternatives and the core keeps printing. Middle case, the core lives but growth slows and it trades like a prove it story. Worst case, you get an abrupt operational hit, CAC rises, margins compress, and the 2030 notes become the overhang everyone pretends not to see. Next things I’m watching are guidance on earnings, any legal or regulatory move that forces immediate operational changes, and unit economics trend ex GLP. One question for bulls: if you strip out GLP1 entirely, what’s your steady state CAC for the core platform after a year of negative headlines? Because that number decides whether the core is durable or just big. Disclosure: no position. Public info only. Not investment advice.

Business A is the cash pay subscription platform: hair, ED, derm, mental health. Recurring revenue, no insurance friction. That engine is real and I’m not here to dunk on it. Business B was the GLP1 compounding era. A national funnel built around a regulatory perimeter that was never meant for mass market distribution. That perimeter tightened, the stock got repriced, and now the whole debate is whether they can unwind that exposure without snapping the core. Before governance, before narrative, the thing that matters is unit economics. Subscriber growth isn’t the flex people think it is if the economics under each subscriber drift the wrong way. You don’t need subs to collapse to get a nasty rerate. You just need the platform to get more expensive to grow. From what’s been publicly reported: non GLP ARPU went from roughly $60 to $55 in a single quarter, Q2 2025. Blended ARPU fell from roughly $84 to $74 over the same window. Marketing was about $218M in Q2 2025 against roughly 73,000 net new subs, which is about $3,000 per marginal add. Gross margin went from roughly 82% in FY2023 to roughly 74% by Q3 2025. Mix and fulfillment complexity doing what they always do to high margin platform narratives. None of that means the company’s dead. It just means the bull case has to be tighter than they have 2.5M subscribers. The real argument is: they can still acquire and retain profitably in a post headline world. If you can’t make that case, everything else is vibes. Now, the 88% lockout. HIMS is effectively controlled by the CEO through a dual class structure. Class A gets one vote. Class V gets 175 votes. Roughly 88% of total voting power sits with the CEO group. He also holds Chairman and committee seats, which narrows internal friction exactly when friction is supposed to protect you as a shareholder. This doesn’t make him evil. It just means outcomes get more binary. When it works, it’s fast. When it doesn’t, there’s no one to pull the brake. You’re underwriting one person’s judgment whether you want to or not. Regulatory and legal. This is where comment sections go stupid, so I’ll keep it tight. This isn’t compounding is illegal now. Patient specific compounding in narrow lawful use cases is a completely different universe from a nationwide, ad driven, subscription checkout GLP1 funnel. The risk sits in the gap between compounding as a clinical exception and compounding as a scaled consumer product. Once enforcement shifts toward copycat framing, the business model gets targeted, not just the drug category. Even if you think they keep some version of weight loss revenue, the question is whether they keep the scaled version that actually moved the needle. And litigation doesn’t need a court loss to hurt you. The process is a tax: fees, distraction, settlement leverage that never fully goes away. Translation: they may keep offering weight loss solutions. The risky part is the national funnel built on a regulatory edge. Okay. The math people keep dodging: the 2030 converts. About $1B in zero coupon convertible notes due May 2030. Conversion price $70.67. Stock’s around $16. Those notes behave like cash debt, not equity dilution. Base case: they’ve reported about $1.1B cash and roughly $300M a year free cash flow. Four years of that is about $1.2B. Add the cash and you’re around $2.3B of firepower against $1B due. That can work. Downside case, the one that actually matters: if GLP1 unwinds fast and free cash flow drops to $100M to $150M a year, four years gives you $400M to $600M. Starting cash $1.1B plus that generation equals $1.5B to $1.7B. Pay the notes and you’re left with $0.5B to $0.7B for everything. Ops, marketing, legal drain. Not bankruptcy. But it turns into a refinancing and capital allocation story that gets louder every quarter the GLP1 line deteriorates. The notes don’t care what you call the pivot. They care whether the cash shows up. Where I land: neutral. HIMS can survive if the GLP1 transition happens in an orderly way and subscriber economics stabilize. If revenue drops faster than management can replace it while legal pressure escalates, this flips from a growth story to a balance sheet story before 2030. What would change my mind: GLP1 exposure declining without a cliff, non GLP unit economics stabilizing, and legal and regulatory outcomes staying bounded. If you want my quick framing: best case, the GLP1 line shrinks gracefully or transitions to compliant alternatives and the core keeps printing. Middle case, the core lives but growth slows and it trades like a prove it story. Worst case, you get an abrupt operational hit, CAC rises, margins compress, and the 2030 notes become the overhang everyone pretends not to see. Next things I’m watching are guidance on earnings, any legal or regulatory move that forces immediate operational changes, and unit economics trend ex GLP. One question for bulls: if you strip out GLP1 entirely, what’s your steady state CAC for the core platform after a year of negative headlines? Because that number decides whether the core is durable or just big. Disclosure: no position. Public info only. Not investment advice.

I recently re-wrote my portfolio allocation plan and I want to explain my reasoning and hopefully have a discussion about what you agree with and what you disagree with and we can all learn in the process. My core thesis is that AI will in fact advance rapidly. My understanding of the underlying technology supports this, and the top researchers and industry leaders are betting big on it as well. That is the core of this portfolio. My expectation is that AI capabilities will match and exceed humans across a broad domain of economically valuable tasks beginning in 2026. This is supported by the METR benchmark, the GDPval benchmark, the observed trajectory of AI research (memory, continual learning, agent swarms) and infrastructure buildout as leading indicators. The wave began with Nvidia's rise, and will expand to the cloud providers as capabilities prove themselves in the coming 0-5 years. Now let's break each segment down. \\--- **Technology** Explained above, this is the core. Key positions are **Nvidia**, which commands the global supply chain for GPUs, the fundamental unit for fueling AI's training *and* inference. This is a highly fungible asset. It can be used to build better models, improve recommendation systems, generate video, audio, proteins, etc. I believe there will always be a high-value use for this. I believe the depreciation concerns are overblown. A100s are being rented out for 95% of their original contract price and those chips are nearly 6 years old. Memory is fundamental to AI accelerators. They're the single largest cost in the bill-of-materials for GPUs and will continue to be necessary regardless of ASICs gaining market share. The new base of consumption for memory is expanding as fast as hyperscaler capex, and the ability for the supply to expand is constrained by complex manufacturing processes like advanced packaging. This means that this time HBM memory suppliers will be slower to catch up to demand than in previous cycles. Cloud is in a strong position because all inference demand funnels here. AI startups may disrupt established enterprises, or the enterprises may win. **I don't know, and no one does.** By betting on this layer of the stack you avoid this risk of disruption and wild narrative and sentiment swings. **Alphabet** stands out as the leader here. They have TPUs, Google Cloud, Gemini, and a distribution base of apps with billions of daily users. Software is a bet on AI beneficiaries. These are companies with large established platforms and user bases that would be difficult to steal. They have all proven to be durable against competition and highly adaptive. They share in having access to very valuable proprietary data that can be a unique competitive advantage against AI native competitors. **Healthcare** **Eli Lilly** is my champion here. I believe the oral GLP-1 that is pending approval will be a truly revolutionary product. It can be produced cheaply and sold at a high margin. It addresses a massive market: obesity and diabetes. It has also been found to improve other conditions such as heart health, Alzheimer's, kidney health, sleep apnea, and inflammation related pains. They also have a significant partnership with Isomorphic Labs from Google, helping them advance AI-led drug discoveries at scale. **Energy** Energy is the primary physical constraint. I'm treating these as a basket that represents power generation across sources, grid, and transmission infrastructure companies. My thesis includes the high probability of data center power demand exceeding available supply around the 2028 time horizon. This will make access to energy the critical bottleneck for further expansion of AI capacity in the US. I expect these companies to be highly durable and accelerate growth over the coming decade. This power constraint should also improve the pricing power of cloud providers with connected active power. **Financial** Berkshire Hathaway is the volatility ballast and quasi-cash reserve. Mastercard is making headway in their services business to monetize data and agentic commerce. Agentic commerce has the potential to go parabolic in the coming 1-2 years and MA owns the rails. JPM has a lot of potential to adopt AI to streamline much of their operations, including algorithmic trading, loan assessment, research, and all manner of administrative tasks. **Defense & Materials** This is the risk hedge. In case of geopolitical conflict or a breakdown of some critical component of the AI pipeline, these stocks will help mitigate some of the loss and allow for rebalancing. They're also not dead weight. Global rearmament is a macro trend and systems are being modernized.

In case of geopolitical conflict or a breakdown of some critical component of the AI pipeline, these stocks will help mitigate some of the loss and allow for rebalancing. They're also not dead weight. Global rearmament is a macro trend and systems are being modernized. Materials act as a fundamental constraint as well, especially copper for energization and interconnection in data center buildouts. *What do you think?* **60% - Technology** * **Semis - 25%** * NVDA - 12% * MU - 6% * TSM - 4% * LRCX - 2% * BESI - 1% * **Cloud - 25%** * GOOGL - 12% * AMZN - 5% * BABA - 4% * CRWV - 2% * ORCL - 1% * IREN - 1% * **Software - 9%** * NFLX - 2% * META - 2% * UBER - 2% * CRM - 1% * NOW - 1% * SHOP - 1% * **Robotics - 1%** * SYM - 1% **10% Healthcare** * LLY - 6% * ISRG - 2% * VEEV - 1% * HIMS - 1% **10% Energy** * FSLR - 3% * GEV - 2% * ETN - 2% * VST - 2% * PWR - 1% **10% Financial** * BRK.B - 4% * MA - 3% * JPM - 3% **10% Defense & Materials** * SHLD - 6% * XLB - 4%", "score": 0, "num_comments": 41, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1r3204h/my_aiheavy_allocation_plan/", "post_url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1r3204h/my_aiheavy_allocation_plan/"}

At What Point Does The Bond Market Push Back", "selftext": "The US national debt has now crossed roughly $38 trillion based on the latest Treasury and debt clock data. That number is so large that most people have become desensitized to it, but the pace of growth is what really stands out. In 2000, total federal debt was about $5.7 trillion. After the 2008 financial crisis it doubled to around $10 trillion. Post pandemic stimulus pushed it above $30 trillion in just a few years. Now we are adding close to $1 trillion every 100 days. Debt to GDP ratio is hovering around 120 percent to 125 percent depending on quarterly revisions. For context, the long term historical average for the US sat near 60 percent before the 2008 era. We are now operating at double that level structurally, not cyclically. What matters for markets is not the absolute debt number but the cost of servicing it.

At What Point Does The Bond Market Push Back The US national debt has now crossed roughly $38 trillion based on the latest Treasury and debt clock data. That number is so large that most people have become desensitized to it, but the pace of growth is what really stands out. In 2000, total federal debt was about $5.7 trillion. After the 2008 financial crisis it doubled to around $10 trillion. Post pandemic stimulus pushed it above $30 trillion in just a few years. Now we are adding close to $1 trillion every 100 days. Debt to GDP ratio is hovering around 120 percent to 125 percent depending on quarterly revisions. For context, the long term historical average for the US sat near 60 percent before the 2008 era. We are now operating at double that level structurally, not cyclically. What matters for markets is not the absolute debt number but the cost of servicing it.

What makes this more interesting is the rumor mill around DeepSeek's next model.

The delay was partly due to difficulties training on Huawei's Ascend chips, which is kind of ironic given the whole point was to reduce dependence on Nvidia.

Initially there was significant concern raised regarding irrational spending plans, higher debt loads, and reduced short to medium term GDP and national revenue. As I believe the markets are also suspecting, Takaichi will pivot to more sound fiscal strategies in line with Gov Ueda (BOJ) and MoF advice. Recent statements from PM Takaichi are supportive of this shift. Thought so. \\* *Chinese De-risking & Cascade Risk*: Chinese regulators have advised domestic financial institutions to reduce exposure to U.S. Treasuries to mitigate concentration risk per Bloomberg, February 9. BRICS nations may take significant note of this posturing and derisking. \\* *Yield Convergence*: Japanese Government Bond yields have reached multi-decade highs, with the 10-year yield at 2.28% and the 30-year at 3.65%. This tightening yield spread is approaching pain territory. \\* *Employment Expectations*: National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett has begun to manage expectations ahead of the Jan Non-Farm Payrolls report, which is forecast at approx. 70k jobs. This media appearance had me intrigued. **The Hassett Productivity-led Expansion Thesis & Critique:** In what appears effectively to be damage control, a televised interview on CNBC, Feb 9 had Kevin Hassett arguing that a sequence of lower employment figures is consistent with GDP growth due to exponential efficiency gains from AI. Further and more unsound in argument, Kevin Kassett stated that the equilibrium employment rate to maintain low unemployment is now lower due to population decline and the deportation of undocumented immigrants. This logic is a facetious conflation of supply efficiency with aggregate demand stability. While AI & tech adoption may increase output per worker, the absence of wage growth or labor demand creates a long-term consumption-inventory mismatch, or glut. Additionally, a contracting labor pool directly reduces the total addressable market of the domestic economy. And to consider international audiences as the desired markets would be at odds with the US position as a net importer. Ultimately fewer participants in the labor market reduces aggregate demand, which is inherently recessionary regardless of productivity gains. The purported productivity gains hypothesis is essentially framing labor market weakness as technological evolution to mask likely resulting future demand contraction. **The road ahead & forks present:** USD, DXY, YEN currently seesawing in no-man's land. Markets likewise. Upcoming events I'm monitoring: Feb 11 NFP. Feb 13 US CPI. Feb 20 US Supreme Court IEEPA. Mar 18 FED rate. Mar 19 BOJ & Trump/Takaichi Summit. **Immediate Post-NFP Avenues/Reactions:** A. A Jobs Surprise OR Accepting the NEC Hypothesis: The market accepts the \\*new\\* equilibrium employment rate thesis, interest rates are held, USD and DXY remain steady, markets remain sideways to upward. A positive surprise may give markets a second wind. Having said that, media appearances by the NEC director frontrunning an important NFP report to calm markets may be a warning signal worth heeding. B. Consumption Contraction: If the employment report confirms a genuine labor market shrink, the productivity argument may lose steam due to aforementioned logical counterarguments. As personal savings sit at a multi-year low of 3.5%, a March rate cut will be increasingly more probable with demand predicted to stangate or reduce. The bigger the job losses the greater the risk of outcomes aligning with research from the Federal Reserve Board, showing that L-shaped recessions may have increasing difficulty returning to pre-recessionary status. A productivity increase as explanation for job reductions only solidifies the reduced likelihood of a jobs rebound. I see increased probability here. Central banks forecast this outcome at circa \\~35%. C. Systemic Liquidation: Should Chinese Treasury divestment accelerate, US yields will likely spike, and resulting instability may trigger breakdown of the 155 USDYEN support, and compress stock multiples. USD bearish, YEN bullish. Not the most likely, however not off the table whatsoever. **The Outlook**: The focus on a lower replacement threshold ignores the reality that high productivity is a liability if the consumer base is obliterated by permanent job losses and household liquidity depletion. The upcoming NFP will be one of several upcoming key factors that I'll be monitoring closely, in shaping the future financial outlook. Defensive positioning may be prudent in these circumstances. I'm currently cash & utility heavy, with a sprinkle of moonshots for funsies.

Silver downgrade kills pricing power. Bear case + puts thesis", "selftext": "Pandora’s recent decision to pivot away from sterling silver and toward platinum-plated jewellery (over their proprietary “Ever-shine” base alloy) is being framed as a smart response to the surge in silver prices. In reality, I think it is one of the worst strategic decisions I have seen from a mass-market luxury-adjacent consumer brand in years. This is not margin optimisation. This is Pandora fundamentally misunderstanding what business it is in, massively overestimating its brand power, and walking directly into a smaller, uglier, structurally inferior market. If I was a shareholder, I would actively campaign against this decision. **1) This decision screams CEO misread (wrong playbook, wrong industry)** Pandora’s new CEO, **Berta de Pablos-Barbier**, has a background that makes this decision make perfect sense to her, while being disastrous for Pandora: * President and CEO of LVMH’s champagne brands (Moët & Chandon, Dom Pérignon, Mercier) * CMO of Lacoste * Senior roles at Boucheron This is a person trained in the world of brand-first luxury, where the product itself is secondary to image, story, and logo. That logic works for champagne (where brand is the product), fashion houses (where the logo is the asset), and high jewellery (where heritage and design allow huge premiums over metal value). Pandora is not in those categories. Pandora is mass-market entry-level luxury jewellery. Their customers are not paying for a 200-year history. They are paying for an accessible version of real jewellery. The problem is that this decision reflects an executive worldview shaped by industries where you can detach the product from the underlying materials and still charge premium prices. Pandora cannot do that. Pandora is not a fashion brand that happens to sell jewellery. Pandora is a jewellery company with a brand premium. And that distinction is everything. **2) Pandora is a jewellery company first, and a brand second** People keep discussing Pandora as if it is a fashion-style brand business where the logo is the product and the underlying materials are irrelevant. It is not. Pandora is, first and foremost, a jewellery company. The brand matters, but it is an overlay on top of the product, not a substitute for it. Pandora’s pricing power exists because customers believe they are buying: * real jewellery (sterling silver) * branded jewellery (so it has trust and resale value) * sentimental jewellery (giftable, symbolic, personal) Pandora is not competing purely on design, scarcity, or craftsmanship. They are competing on the idea that you can buy something real, durable, and valuable without paying Tiffany prices. That is why Pandora can charge significantly more than Chinese and Indian OEM jewellery and unbranded charm products. Their customers might not understand metal markets, but they absolutely understand the difference between: * sterling silver * plated alloy Even if they cannot articulate it, they feel it instinctively. **3) Sterling silver gives Pandora a resale floor that plating destroys** Sterling silver is currently around **$2.40 per gram**. That means Pandora jewellery has something costume jewellery does not. It has an embedded commodity floor value. Even if the jewellery is scratched, damaged, or destroyed, the owner can still scrap it. That matters psychologically even if most customers never actually do it. And beyond melt value, Pandora pieces often resell above scrap because the brand adds a premium. This is why Pandora works so well as a gift product. It feels like a real asset. Now compare that to plated alloy. Platinum plating sounds luxurious, but in reality the amount of platinum used is microscopic. It is essentially dusting the surface. Even if Pandora’s Ever-shine alloy is decent, the scrap value of the metal content in a small charm is basically nothing. You are not going to take a plated charm to a jeweller and get meaningful money for it. If sterling silver is roughly $2.40 per gram, the metal value of a plated charm is closer to something like **$0.01 to $0.06 per gram**, depending on the alloy, plating thickness, and composition. Pandora’s alloy is proprietary so we cannot know exactly, but the point is obvious. From the customer’s perspective, the intrinsic value of plated alloy jewellery is effectively **zero**. So Pandora is destroying the “worst case” floor that has supported its pricing power for decades. Pandora’s management seems to think customers will not notice because the jewellery still looks shiny and premium. They will notice. Because the next step is predictable. The deeper issue is what this decision signals to the market. If Pandora has to strip out sterling silver to protect margins, it is effectively admitting that their historical profitability depended on selling precious metal at a premium. In other words, their pricing power may have been weaker than investors assumed. A company with true brand-led pricing power would pass higher input costs through to consumers. A company forced to downgrade materials is signalling that it cannot. **4) Pandora is making the worst possible product for plating: daily-wear jewellery** Plated jewellery can work in costume jewellery because most costume jewellery is worn occasionally. It is statement pieces worn to events, nights out, or parties, often larger necklaces, cuffs, and bangles. Those items do not see heavy daily wear. Pandora’s core products are the exact opposite: * charm bracelets * rings * stackable pieces * things people wear every day I personally know multiple people who wear their Pandora charm bracelet daily without taking it off. Daily wear is brutal. Constant friction, sweat, soap, perfume exposure, banging against surfaces, repeated abrasion on bracelet links and charm holes. Plating will wear off. Once it wears off, you get tarnish, discolouration, skin staining, and turning green complaints. And it does not matter how much Pandora insists their alloy is premium or proprietary. All it takes is one widely-shared meme: **Pandora turns green now.** And the brand is permanently damaged. Pandora is voluntarily walking into a predictable consumer backlash cycle that has destroyed countless mid-market jewellery brands. **5) This move forces Pandora into costume jewellery whether they admit it or not** If you remove sterling silver as the core material, Pandora becomes costume jewellery. This is not an opinion. It is literally a category shift. They can call it innovation or sustainability or new materials, but the consumer translation is simple: **Pandora is plated jewellery now.** And that is the exact positioning Pandora spent decades avoiding. Pandora’s customers did not choose Pandora because they wanted fashion accessories. They chose Pandora because it felt like the cheapest way to buy real jewellery with status attached. That is what is being destroyed. **6) The costume jewellery market is smaller, uglier, and structurally terrible** People do not understand how important market structure is here. The global costume jewellery market is valued around **$31 to $45 billion (2023 to 2024).** Now compare that to fine jewellery: * broader global jewellery market is estimated **$350 to $380 billion in 2025** * projected to exceed **$500 billion by 2033** * luxury jewellery segment specifically is **$49 to $66 billion (2024)**, with strong growth driven by Asia-Pacific demand So Pandora is pivoting away from a category adjacent to a hundreds-of-billions global market, and pushing itself into a far smaller, more commoditised, brutally competitive market. This is not a smart pivot. This is moving into a segment with worse economics. Costume jewellery is dominated by two kinds of players. First, fashion houses like Dior, Gucci, Chanel, and so on. They derive pricing power from clothing prestige. The jewellery is just an extension of the logo. Pandora does not have that type of prestige. Second, low-cost fast fashion and OEM supply chains. This is where the real competition is. Chinese and Indian manufacturers producing plated jewellery at absurdly low cost. Once Pandora becomes plated jewellery, it is forced into competition with an industrial machine that will undercut it forever. That is a race to the bottom. **7) History already shows what happens: the mid-tier costume giants collapsed** The best evidence that this market is terrible is that the old dominant names in costume jewellery are either dead or irrelevant. The mid-century American giants include Coro, Trifari, Monet, and Napier. These brands were huge. They had scale, recognition, and distribution. And the market still wiped them out. Some exist as trademarks, but the industrial powerhouses are gone. This is what happens when you sell non-precious jewellery at a premium without the fashion-house prestige moat. Pandora is voluntarily placing itself on the same path. **8) Swarovski exists, but Swarovski’s success proves the opposite of what Pandora thinks** If Pandora wants to play in premium costume jewellery, the obvious comparable is Swarovski. And to be clear, Swarovski is not collapsing. Their jewellery business is actually performing well. Swarovski’s Crystal Business generated **€1.906 billion in revenue in FY2024**, with 6 percent organic growth, jewellery sales growing 9 percent organically, lab-grown diamond sales more than doubling, and the company returning to profitability. So the lesson is not that Swarovski is failing. The lesson is why Swarovski is succeeding. Swarovski’s pricing power comes from something Pandora does not have. A genuine product identity. Swarovski is not generic costume jewellery. Swarovski is crystals. It has a materials story, a visual signature, and an instantly recognisable aesthetic that competitors cannot replicate without being obvious copies. Pandora has no equivalent. And Swarovski’s strategy is built around bold, colourful, extravagant statement design. Their LUXignite strategy positions Swarovski as “pop luxury” built on visual spectacle, plus a credible move into lab-grown diamonds. Pandora cannot replicate that. Pandora’s brand identity is fundamentally understated and sentimental. Its hero products are charm bracelets and stackable everyday pieces. If Swarovski’s identity is spectacle, Pandora’s identity is safe, wearable, and personal. So when Pandora shifts away from sterling silver into plated alloy, it does not read as reinvention. It reads as cost cutting. It reads as downgrade. That is the key difference. Swarovski’s customer experiences an upgrade in design and identity. Pandora’s customer experiences a reduction in material value. And in jewellery, that distinction is fatal. **9) The other comps do not work: Alexis Bittar and Kenneth Jay Lane are not Pandora** Other premium costume jewellery brands include Alexis Bittar and Kenneth Jay Lane. But these brands are design-led and niche. They are aimed at an older, more fashion-forward demographic and built around statement aesthetics. Pandora is the opposite. Mass-market, sentimental gift-driven, everyday wear, repetitive charm concept. Pandora cannot reposition into that design niche without losing its existing customer base. So Pandora is entering a market where it does not have fashion-house prestige, it does not have Swarovski’s crystal identity, and it does not have design-cult uniqueness. Which means it has no moat. **10) Once Pandora’s perceived quality collapses, pricing power is gone forever** Pandora’s current positioning is a very delicate sweet spot. It is above cheap high street jewellery, below fine luxury houses, real enough to justify the spend, accessible enough to be mass-market. That is why Pandora works. But if consumers start associating Pandora with tarnish, plating wear, green skin, and cheap alloy, Pandora loses its premium perception. Once that happens, the market forces Pandora down. They will be forced to cut prices to compete with Thomas Sabo, Lovisa, cheap Amazon brands, Shein-tier jewellery, and Chinese and Indian OEM supply. At that point, Pandora becomes a commodity retailer with a fading logo. And it will never regain its old pricing power. Brand perception moves down quickly and moves up extremely slowly. **11) Competitors will eat them once the brand is weakened** If Pandora loses its sterling silver anchor, competitors will take their market share. There are already strong alternatives: * Thomas Sabo * Lovisa * Trollbeads * Chamilia (owned by Swarovski, which is telling) * general fashion jewellery substitutes Pandora is basically handing them a free opportunity. Especially Chamilia, which already competes in the charm segment with Swarovski backing and costume jewellery expertise. **12) Moving down-market also blocks moving up-market** Once Pandora damages its brand perception, it traps itself. If it tries to go down-market, it faces OEM competition. If it tries to go up-market later, it faces Trollbeads (higher quality, rarer, less mass-market), Tiffany and Co, David Yurman, and real fine jewellery brands. Pandora copied Trollbeads’ entire concept originally, but Trollbeads has scarcity and craftsmanship Pandora cannot replicate at scale. Pandora has no easy upward path once it abandons its real metal identity. **13) Collabs are at risk: Disney is not guaranteed forever** Pandora has relied heavily on collaborations. Disney (major), Bridgerton (recent), and other branded tie-ins. If Pandora’s perceived quality collapses, those partner brands may reassess whether they want their IP associated with cheap plated jewellery. Disney already sells down-market costume jewellery. Pandora was attractive because it was above that tier. If Pandora becomes indistinguishable from lower market costume products, Disney can demand better terms, reduce partnership intensity, or walk entirely. Losing Disney would be catastrophic because Disney products are a meaningful share of Pandora’s demand engine. **14) The core problem: Pandora cannot detach itself from materials like true luxury can** In high jewellery, brands can charge massive premiums over metal value because they have centuries of heritage, design leadership, cultural prestige, craftsmanship narratives, and scarcity. Pandora has none of those moats. Pandora’s moat is scale, distribution, and real metal at accessible prices. If Pandora removes the real metal component, they are betting that their logo alone can support premium pricing. That is a luxury fashion assumption. And it is wrong. Even in luxury jewellery and fashion, materials still matter. Construction quality still matters. People still care about what they are actually buying. In high jewellery, materials matter even more than brand in the vast majority of cases. A Cartier necklace still needs to be gold. A Van Cleef piece still needs to be constructed properly. A Boucheron client still cares about stone quality. Pandora seems to be forgetting that jewellery is not champagne. Jewellery is not a t-shirt. Jewellery is not perfume. You cannot strip out the material value and expect the brand to survive unchanged. **Conclusion: This is not margin management, it is a value-destructive decision** Pandora switching from sterling silver to platinum-plated alloy is like a premium denim brand switching from real denim to polyester to protect margins. The spreadsheet looks better short term. The brand is structurally impaired long term. Pandora is not moving into a new innovative category. They are voluntarily stepping down into costume jewellery, a market that is smaller ($31 to $45B), brutally commoditised, structurally dominated by fashion houses and OEM mass production, and historically a graveyard for mid-tier premium brands. And they are doing it with the worst possible product format (daily-wear charm bracelets and rings), guaranteeing that plating failure becomes a consumer meme. Once the meme exists, Pandora’s pricing power collapses. Once pricing power collapses, Pandora is forced down-market. Once Pandora is down-market, it is fighting Shein and OEM factories. And that is not a business model. That is slow liquidation disguised as strategy. If shareholders are rational, they should fight this decision aggressively before Pandora permanently destroys the one thing that made the company valuable. Its position as the world’s default real jewellery for normal people. This is irreversible brand damage. **TL;DR:** Pandora switching from sterling silver to platinum-plated alloy is not a harmless cost-saving move. It is a structural downgrade that destroys the material value floor and “real jewellery” perception that underpins their pricing power. Because Pandora is daily-wear jewellery (bracelets, rings), plating wear and tarnish complaints will explode, damaging brand equity and forcing them down-market into a commoditised costume jewellery segment where they will be crushed by OEM imports and cheaper competitors. Swarovski works because it has a distinct crystal identity and reinvention narrative. Pandora’s move reads as cost-cutting and downgrade, not reinvention.

Management expects profits of €24-26 million this year and €30 million next year, with annual growth of 20% projected through 2028.

Strong Balance Sheet: A net cash position of €169 million (€278 million in cash versus €109 million in debt) provides them with flexibility and a financial cushion. Their equity ratio is 25.4%. The Business: They are more than just one thing – they offer consumer loans (Ferratum), SME financing (CapitalBox), and corporate banking services in 17 European markets.

Operational Improvement: The cost-to-income ratio has decreased from 61% to 48% and is projected to reach 40% by 2028. Loan loss provisions have decreased by 29%, demonstrating sound risk management.

(NYSE: SNAP) has experienced significant volatility over the past several years, currently trading in the mid-single to low-double digit range depending on market sentiment and earnings cycles. The stock remains well below its historical highs, reflecting broader pressure across digital advertising platforms as well as company-specific challenges related to user monetization and competition. Snap originally gained traction as a fast-growing social media platform built around ephemeral messaging, augmented reality features, and a strong appeal among younger demographics. At its peak growth stage, the company benefited from rapid user adoption and increasing advertiser demand for mobile-focused engagement tools. However, the digital advertising landscape has changed significantly over the last few years, creating both structural and cyclical challenges for Snap’s business model. From a financial perspective, Snap has experienced periods of slowing revenue growth. Recent earnings reports have shown quarterly revenue growth that has moderated compared to earlier expansion phases. Advertising remains the company’s primary revenue driver, and fluctuations in advertiser spending have had a direct impact on top-line performance. Macroeconomic uncertainty has also influenced advertising budgets across multiple industries, creating additional volatility in Snap’s revenue trends. User growth has remained relatively stable, with Snap continuing to report strong daily active user engagement, particularly among Gen Z demographics. However, investor concerns increasingly focus on monetization efficiency rather than raw user growth. Average revenue per user has faced pressure as advertisers evaluate return on investment and shift budgets between competing platforms such as Meta, TikTok, and emerging social video ecosystems. On the cost side, Snap has implemented multiple restructuring initiatives aimed at improving operating efficiency. Over the past two years, the company reduced workforce size and consolidated several internal product divisions. Management has emphasized streamlining product development while prioritizing core revenue-generating features. These cost reduction measures have improved operating discipline but have not fully offset revenue growth concerns. Snap has continued to invest heavily in augmented reality and artificial intelligence capabilities as long-term differentiation strategies. The company’s AR lens ecosystem and creator tools remain among the most advanced within social media platforms. Snap has positioned these tools as future monetization channels through branded AR advertising, creator partnerships, and interactive commerce experiences. While these technologies offer long-term potential, near-term revenue contribution remains uncertain and dependent on advertiser adoption. Competitive pressure remains one of Snap’s most significant strategic challenges. Larger platforms with broader user ecosystems benefit from scale advantages in advertising analytics, targeting infrastructure, and cross-platform engagement. TikTok’s rapid expansion in short-form video and Meta’s continued investment in AI-driven ad targeting have intensified competition for user attention and advertiser budgets. From a trading standpoint, SNAP has demonstrated elevated volatility around earnings announcements, macro advertising trends, and broader technology sector sentiment. Technical patterns have shown repeated testing of support levels during weaker advertising cycles, followed by sharp rallies during periods of improved guidance or stronger user engagement metrics. Trading volume often increases significantly during earnings releases, indicating strong institutional and retail participation. Long-term strategic outlook for Snap largely depends on the company’s ability to improve advertising monetization while maintaining strong user engagement among younger demographics. The platform’s brand identity and cultural relevance remain valuable intangible assets. Additionally, Snap’s early leadership in AR technology may provide strategic optionality if immersive digital advertising and social commerce adoption accelerate over time. However, several risk factors remain. Advertising spending remains highly cyclical and sensitive to economic conditions. Competition for digital advertising share continues to intensify across social media platforms. Additionally, continued investment in emerging technologies requires balancing long-term innovation with near-term profitability expectations. From a valuation perspective, SNAP often trades based on forward growth expectations rather than current profitability metrics. This dynamic contributes to higher volatility relative to more mature advertising platforms. Investor sentiment tends to shift rapidly based on revenue growth trajectories and management guidance regarding advertiser demand. Overall, Snap represents a technology platform transitioning from early hyper-growth toward a more mature monetization and efficiency-focused phase. The company retains strong brand recognition and technological differentiation in augmented reality, but its ability to translate engagement into sustainable advertising revenue remains the central investment debate.

They make electrical distribution equipment - transformers, switchgear, PDUs, power skids, the stuff that moves electricity from the grid to your servers. Not sexy but completely essential. Every data center, every utility substation, every big manufacturing plant needs this stuff. FY25 revenue: $753M (up 56% YoY) Adjusted EBITDA: $169M (22.5% margin) Adjusted net income: $88.7M Backlog: $1.03B as of Sept 2025 Q1 FY26 came in at $283M revenue which is 84% growth. The backlog being larger than full year revenue gives decent visibility. One thing I noticed - they lead with adjusted figures everywhere. GAAP net income isn't prominently disclosed which usually means there's a meaningful gap. They're adjusting out amortization from acquisitions, sponsor fees, integration costs, stock comp, etc. The adjustments are defensible given the situation but I'd like to see full GAAP figures. This is a PE roll-up. Neos Partners bought four separate companies between Oct 2023 and June 2024: MGM Transformer (Oct 2023) PwrQ (March 2024) States Manufacturing (May 2024) VanTran (June 2024) So they've been operating as a combined entity for less than two years. Revenue breakdown: Data centers: 42% Grid/utilities: 23% Industrial: 19% Other: 16% By product type: Custom/engineered-to-order: 91% Standard products: 5% Services: 4% The custom work is where the margins are. They're not competing on price with commodity stuff. Their CEO is Gary Niederpruem who was at Vertiv before this, their largest comparable and another power infra company. He was part of the leadership team that carved Emerson Network Power out of Emerson Electric and turned it into Vertiv. That's probably the most relevant experience you could ask for - he's literally done this before with a similar business. CFO Ryan Fiedler came from Caterpillar where he was CFO of their Resource Industries segment ($12B+ in revenue). So the management bench is legitimately experienced. As mentioned above, Vertiv is the big dog in data center power/cooling infrastructure, currently trading around $135 with a $50B+ market cap. Pros: * AI buildout, grid modernization, manufacturing reshoring - all of this requires electrical equipment * Supply constrained market. Lead times for this stuff can be 2-4 years from some suppliers. Forgent claims their lead times are 30-65% shorter than industry average * Capacity expansion almost done. They've invested $205M to expand manufacturing, should support up to $5B in revenue without major additional capex * Management knows the space Cons: * This is a PE exit. 70% of the IPO is secondary (existing shareholders cashing out). Only 30% is primary shares with proceeds going to the company. Neos wants liquidity. * Roll-up risk. Four acquisitions in 8 months is aggressive and its unproven as a combined entity. Less than 2 years of operating history together. * Valuation is rich for what's essentially a bet that the pieces fit together * Data center exposure cuts both ways.

Revenue breakdown: Data centers: 42% Grid/utilities: 23% Industrial: 19% Other: 16% By product type: Custom/engineered-to-order: 91% Standard products: 5% Services: 4% The custom work is where the margins are. They're not competing on price with commodity stuff. Their CEO is Gary Niederpruem who was at Vertiv before this, their largest comparable and another power infra company. He was part of the leadership team that carved Emerson Network Power out of Emerson Electric and turned it into Vertiv. That's probably the most relevant experience you could ask for - he's literally done this before with a similar business. CFO Ryan Fiedler came from Caterpillar where he was CFO of their Resource Industries segment ($12B+ in revenue). So the management bench is legitimately experienced. As mentioned above, Vertiv is the big dog in data center power/cooling infrastructure, currently trading around $135 with a $50B+ market cap. Pros: * AI buildout, grid modernization, manufacturing reshoring - all of this requires electrical equipment * Supply constrained market. Lead times for this stuff can be 2-4 years from some suppliers. Forgent claims their lead times are 30-65% shorter than industry average * Capacity expansion almost done. They've invested $205M to expand manufacturing, should support up to $5B in revenue without major additional capex * Management knows the space Cons: * This is a PE exit. 70% of the IPO is secondary (existing shareholders cashing out). Only 30% is primary shares with proceeds going to the company. Neos wants liquidity. * Roll-up risk. Four acquisitions in 8 months is aggressive and its unproven as a combined entity. Less than 2 years of operating history together. * Valuation is rich for what's essentially a bet that the pieces fit together * Data center exposure cuts both ways. If AI capex slows down they're exposed.", "score": 43, "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1qveel5/upcoming_ipo_no_one_is_talking_about_forgent/", "post_url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1qveel5/upcoming_ipo_no_one_is_talking_about_forgent/"}

Because Amazon is offering an ideal product at an 80percent cheaper price. If I’m looking to advertise between TTD and Amazon 9/10 I’m going with Amazon. I think the walled garden dismissal of Amazon is a critical mistake on the investors part. Many current clients of TTD may not want to pay out 80percent more because of some conspiracy like conflict of interest. Firstly it is a conspiracy that Amazon will treat them differently even if they are a competitor, it’s completely unfounded but a still reasonable consideration.

Jeff Green worth 2.3Billion is anything but communicative with investors/shareholders. I want you to think about this, Jeff Green has only sold shares in the past years of TTD but has never bought any shares. I understand he gets stock based Comp, but he sold 181million dollars last year. Think about this for one second and it becomes obvious. \\*if you the CEO believe your company is being wrongly priced having access to financials after a singificant correction in your stock you’d be buying with that insight hand over fist. That is what a good CEO DOES,not sell exessively Jeff Green has sold 500million dollars worth of shares since 2021(4.3million shares) . He now has 1.3million. He couldn’t buy 100million of his own company after a significant correction? He gets paid in stock comp, okay explain Why TF you’d sell 500million worth and not buy back in at a far lower price? Because he doesn’t believe in TTD future or that the stock price reflects what he’d value it at that’s why. I get wanting to believe in a company…but how can you believe in someone like Jeff Green who’s been radio silent this entire year and hasn’t even considered buying his own stock with idk 20percent of what he’s withdrawn? What does he really need 500million dollars for anyways? For the record Jensen Huang Sold 1 billion since 2021(Nvidia CEO/most expensive company). 3 CFO changes spells a horrible future for the company in under 1 year, I’ll link thee opinions of an unrelated company that had this happen a year ago and the unbiased opinions from this thread.

He couldn’t buy 100million of his own company after a significant correction? He gets paid in stock comp, okay explain Why TF you’d sell 500million worth and not buy back in at a far lower price? Because he doesn’t believe in TTD future or that the stock price reflects what he’d value it at that’s why. I get wanting to believe in a company…but how can you believe in someone like Jeff Green who’s been radio silent this entire year and hasn’t even considered buying his own stock with idk 20percent of what he’s withdrawn? What does he really need 500million dollars for anyways? For the record Jensen Huang Sold 1 billion since 2021(Nvidia CEO/most expensive company). 3 CFO changes spells a horrible future for the company in under 1 year, I’ll link thee opinions of an unrelated company that had this happen a year ago and the unbiased opinions from this thread. [ https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/s/6c8IAKeRw5 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/s/6c8IAKeRw5) So CEO sucks, mote is dying, margins will compress, higher PE than Amazon, leading me to believe TTD is still overvalued. I would like to preface I could be wrong, some may disagree, this is what I believe. This could be a tailwind for TTD but I Think It’s more of an impending doom on the horizon for TTD. I highly encourage different perspectives and not 2nd grade jabs,uninspired snide rhetoric Reddit/what gets me likes. i hope to see your opinions and thoughts on this company.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 19, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1quaaxn/ttd_isnt_a_turn_around_story/", "post_url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1quaaxn/ttd_isnt_a_turn_around_story/"}

Oracle is raising money in order to build additional capacity to meet the contracted demand from our largest Oracle Cloud Infrastructure customers, including AMD, Meta, NVIDIA, OpenAI, TikTok, xAI and others. Oracle expects to raise $45 to $50 billion of gross cash proceeds during the 2026 calendar year. The company plans to achieve its funding objective by using a balanced combination of debt and equity financing to maintain a solid investment-grade balance sheet. On the equity side, Oracle plans to raise approximately half of its 2026 funding through a combination of equity-linked and common equity issuances. This is expected to include an initial issuance of mandatory convertible preferred securities, representing a modest portion of the overall equity funding, as well as a newly authorized at-the-market equity program of up to $20 billion. The company plans to issue equity from the at-the-market program flexibly over time at prevailing market prices, based on market conditions and capital needs. On the debt side, Oracle intends to complete a single, one-time issuance of investment-grade senior unsecured bonds early in 2026 to cover the other half of the company's planned funding for the year.

This funding plan reflects Oracle's commitment to maintaining an investment-grade rating, prudent capital allocation, balance sheet strength, and transparency with investors as the company continues to expand its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure business.

Inotiv :absolutely massive discount, from its high its 96 percent down, 96 percent off for a company that sells services to half the pharma companies. But current environment does not favor it. Adobe Has fallen over thirty percent, loved by value investors. Could fall another ten percent but a new product in the future may suprise investors. But at this point in time growth is an issue. I think figma is a stronger growth stock. Tradesk Fallen seventy percent, but still overpriced, no real discount. Toast, one year low. Expanding Tam and upsell potential, but competition means margins may be squeezed. Cover / Lightspeed Commerce / oracle could put pressure on toast. Amplitude - minus 20 this month: Amplitude is a clear winner in analytics, its analytics are used by everyone in an organization but low pricing power with too many competitors Similarweb unbelievable discount of 70 percent for an analytics company about to turn profitable,May be bought over by hyperscalers who want their analytics , but hyperscalers might deepen their own analytic capabilities especially since they have the data ,alternatively hyperscalers might buy a smaller analytics company. Reddit reached a three month low, falling by 16 percent , which isnt much considering how much the company is up. But if you really wanted to invest in reddit you can buy on dips strategy( each time it hits a three month low). Could go mich lower could go much higher so the discount isnt something you would use-to determine whether to buy Etsy ‘ minus ten percent- not really a significant drop for a midsize company already priced high. But etsy has high margins and is heavily underestimated on growth. Pinterest, year low, uncertainty, more flimsy compared to amazon tik tok meta, but growth potential is massive.Already transitioning to growth company. Root down 36 percent this year Could potentially beat traditional insurers but even if it proves its AI works a lot better, telematics is not a monopoly anymore. If every insurer adds telematics hard to see roots advantage. Rezolve, 2.60 from its height of 6. The only stock here that could tenx, Rezolve is moving from r and d gear and now going into full force sales gear . Figma, although its been around a long time still a very young company and business model will change over the next two years. This one might be worth investing once we have a clearer idea of business model and products. When they were publishing their ipo and sec it hinted there were going to move beyond credit pricing to outcome prising. Wait for proof then buy! Upwork, this is my favorite for value. Pe under ten. Ai teams , Ai matching and many users mean a strong moat.Margins are improving as well Small caps Rime, another one of my favourites , it fixes three things, empty miles, failed logistic model, and indian messy logistics. Is it priced in? Well that depends on what you think Rimes true TAM is? Do you think its all logistics, or only niche logistics. On one hand youve got many competitors, on the other hand Rime can work with competitors. Worksport down 80 percent selling a product that hasnt been sold before so no way to say this is a buy. But the science works, and they sell an incredibly useful product, truck covers that can solar charge. Arrive Ai Another logistics company (drones plus boxnow) Arrive AI is used for high value, delicate deliveries such as medicine that needs to be kept at a certain temperature but integration with legacy systems is no easy task Duolingo Massive discount, for great quality companany Ui path minus twenty percent in a month. Ui path: best in class ai integration , but very expensive especially for a smaller company upgrading to the pro plan Railvision Train safety and predictive insights into infrastructure but regulatory hurdles, and long upgrade cycles Diginex (DGNX)- massive discount 98 percent Regulatory ESG makes sure some customers will buy. But who will customers buy from currently diginex Esg is competitors have the advantage with scale, credibility, Jet Ai - massive discount 98 Percent in the last two months AI optimization improves fleet utilization, however has no real moat, no pricing power, costs are high, sensitive to customer spend. Growth buys: Pininterest, Rezolve Toast Strong buys: Microsoft Upwork Buys: Adobe , Figma ( between the two figma has more upside unlesss adobe suprises us) Buy later: Snowflake, Reddit .

My main advice to new investors is to take full advantage of their TFSA, it's the best place to make moonshots like this one. I started with $15,300 back in 2022, and as of now, I'm sitting at around $390,000. That's a 2450% gain, all from straight-up stock picks without any leverage, options, or fancy trading strategies. I buy and hold on what I believe are undervalued plays in emerging tech. I usually find these new tech companies from reading DARPA reports or searching the internet and probing AI. I fully de-risk my positions usually when they double and let the rest run or re-evaluate if the thesis changes which I have already done with this stock! The bulk of my portfolio currently is in Hydrograph Clean Power (HG.CN on CSE, HGRAF on OTCQB), a graphene company that's tackling the big challenges in the industry: quality and scalability. Graphene has insane potential and it cannot be understated. Nanomaterials are undoubtedly the future, they can and will revolutionize nearly everything. The global graphene market's is projected to grow at a 40% CAGR over the next few years, and Hydrograph is positioning itself as a leader with their patented detonation synthesis method to capture the majority of that market share. Why am I bullish? Traditional graphene production is messy, expensive, and inconsistent. Hydrograph's process uses acetylene gas in a controlled explosion to make ultra-pure graphene at scale, using no energy and whilst producing hydrogen syngas which is beneficial for the environment. Their Hyperion machines are effectively money printers a 10-tonne unit costs about $150k to build and can churn out $2.5-8 million worth of product per year (250-800k per tonne for their fractal graphene depending on the application), with profit margins north of 80%. Low inputs, high output, and a massive moat from their patents. They're seeing positive impacts across industries at super low loadings (0.0015%-0.05%), meaning a tiny bit of their graphene boosts performance in plastics, coatings, batteries, and more without jacking up costs. I'm expecting the stock to at least double this year as they hit milestones/catalysts. Key ones I'm watching and waiting for: EPA approval for broader commercial use. An aerospace contract A Top 10 automotive manufacturer contract NASDAQ uplisting Completing buildouts of their HQ and production facilities in Austin and Houston, Texas I've done my DD, and while the stock's volatile (it's a small-cap play), the fundamentals scream asymmetric upside. Recent news like expanding their Hyperion reactor production and new partnerships (e.g., with Hubron International for compounding) show they're executing. TL;DR: Started with $15.3k in 2022, now at \\~$390k (2450% gain) via buy-and-hold stocks, no leverage/options. Heavily in Hydrograph Clean Power (HG.CN/HGRAF) for graphene tech solving quality/scalability issues. Bullish on 2026 catalysts like EPA approval, aerospace/auto contracts, NASDAQ uplist, and facility buildouts in TX.

Let's discuss!", "text": "2450% Gain since 2022 - No Leverage, No options. I wanted to share my investing story so far, to encourage others to start. My main advice to new investors is to take full advantage of their TFSA, it's the best place to make moonshots like this one. I started with $15,300 back in 2022, and as of now, I'm sitting at around $390,000. That's a 2450% gain, all from straight-up stock picks without any leverage, options, or fancy trading strategies. I buy and hold on what I believe are undervalued plays in emerging tech. I usually find these new tech companies from reading DARPA reports or searching the internet and probing AI. I fully de-risk my positions usually when they double and let the rest run or re-evaluate if the thesis changes which I have already done with this stock! The bulk of my portfolio currently is in Hydrograph Clean Power (HG.CN on CSE, HGRAF on OTCQB), a graphene company that's tackling the big challenges in the industry: quality and scalability. Graphene has insane potential and it cannot be understated. Nanomaterials are undoubtedly the future, they can and will revolutionize nearly everything. The global graphene market's is projected to grow at a 40% CAGR over the next few years, and Hydrograph is positioning itself as a leader with their patented detonation synthesis method to capture the majority of that market share. Why am I bullish? Traditional graphene production is messy, expensive, and inconsistent. Hydrograph's process uses acetylene gas in a controlled explosion to make ultra-pure graphene at scale, using no energy and whilst producing hydrogen syngas which is beneficial for the environment. Their Hyperion machines are effectively money printers a 10-tonne unit costs about $150k to build and can churn out $2.5-8 million worth of product per year (250-800k per tonne for their fractal graphene depending on the application), with profit margins north of 80%. Low inputs, high output, and a massive moat from their patents. They're seeing positive impacts across industries at super low loadings (0.0015%-0.05%), meaning a tiny bit of their graphene boosts performance in plastics, coatings, batteries, and more without jacking up costs. I'm expecting the stock to at least double this year as they hit milestones/catalysts. Key ones I'm watching and waiting for: EPA approval for broader commercial use. An aerospace contract A Top 10 automotive manufacturer contract NASDAQ uplisting Completing buildouts of their HQ and production facilities in Austin and Houston, Texas I've done my DD, and while the stock's volatile (it's a small-cap play), the fundamentals scream asymmetric upside. Recent news like expanding their Hyperion reactor production and new partnerships (e.g., with Hubron International for compounding) show they're executing. TL;DR: Started with $15.3k in 2022, now at \\~$390k (2450% gain) via buy-and-hold stocks, no leverage/options. Heavily in Hydrograph Clean Power (HG.CN/HGRAF) for graphene tech solving quality/scalability issues. Bullish on 2026 catalysts like EPA approval, aerospace/auto contracts, NASDAQ uplist, and facility buildouts in TX. Their Hyperion machines enable 80%+ margins, massive moat in 40% CAGR graphene market. DYOR, not advice. Full disclosure: This is my personal journey and opinion (not financial advice).

One of the perks was free Car wash tokens, and quite quickly, I realized how relaxing it could be to leave your phone at home, and spend a few minutes away from it all, absorbed in pressure washing the dirt of your car. Though I’ve long since left that job, for years, I’ve felt secure knowing that when work gets stressful, my team loses in overtime, or my girlfriend is having a K-drama night with her mom, for only a few dollars, I could forget about everything, if only for half an hour, and escape to my happy place: the self-serve carwash.

No, I don’t need the ultra-wash package, just the basic (which is now 20% more expensive.) And no, I don’t want to download an app, or sign up to a subscription service. This isn’t a tech start up. 2. No more simple business names These firms keep buying up mom-and-pop shops, “rolling them up” into a bigger conglomerate, and enjoying the economies of scale. Beyond the negative effects this has on consumers (monopoly pricing power, reducing services in less profitable areas) and employees (They no longer need 10 accounting departments, just 1, here is your pink slip), I’ve also noticed they change the names and logos. No more Kowalski and Sons HVAC, or Ms. Wilson’s tailoring. No more logos made by someone’s nephew who had a knack for drawing. Now every company’s name and logo look like some hyper modern sterile data analytics company, and I no longer know what a company does just by seeing their name or logo on a truck or storefront. 3.

Not once have I seen a PE-backed firm sponsor a local team, or support a community run event.

And lately, I’ve not been so happy about how much I have to spend to get so little. But I LOVE free samples. It’s one of life’s little pleasures. Mozzarella sticks? Chicken wings?

I concede that a lot of my complaints are banal when it comes to the big picture. The rising inequality, the precariousness of modern jobs, the introduction of the profit motive into many of the services we rely on.

I concede that a lot of my complaints are banal when it comes to the big picture. The rising inequality, the precariousness of modern jobs, the introduction of the profit motive into many of the services we rely on. That’s all much more concerning than the absence of a free jalapeno popper while I look for the Greek yogurt. Still, I miss those jalapeno poppers.", "score": 756, "num_comments": 112, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1r5hwj8/6_reasons_private_equity_annoys_me_a_rant/", "post_url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1r5hwj8/6_reasons_private_equity_annoys_me_a_rant/"}

The stock is trading around $164 after surging more than 15% in a single session, even though Q4 results were, on the surface, disappointing. At first glance, the numbers weren’t great. The company posted a surprise net loss, revenue came in below expectations, and trading volumes dropped sharply as the broader crypto market cooled. Consumer transaction revenue fell heavily year over year, a direct reflection of weaker crypto prices and reduced retail activity. And that’s the key point. Coinbase is highly sensitive to market cycles. When crypto is booming, transaction revenue explodes. When sentiment dries up, so does volume. With Bitcoin starting 2026 in bear territory, pressure on trading-based platforms was inevitable. But here’s where it gets interesting. Adjusted for crypto-related losses, Coinbase still generated positive earnings. Subscription and services revenue grew, showing that the company is slowly diversifying beyond pure spot trading. That matters. It suggests the business isn’t standing still during the downturn. So why did the stock rally so aggressively on weak headline numbers? Because markets price expectations, not just results. Going into earnings, COIN had already fallen heavily year-to-date. A lot of fear was already baked into the price. When reality arrived and it wasn’t catastrophic, investors stepped in. That’s classic relief-rally behavior. Personally, I’ve been catching this move through stock futures on Bitget. That’s one advantage of having access to tokenized or futures exposure to U.S. equities within a crypto-native platform, you can react to volatility without switching ecosystems. Instead of watching the bounce from the sidelines, I positioned around the earnings volatility and rode the momentum. Not blindly, but with clear risk management, because these moves can reverse just as fast. From a broader perspective, this rally says more about market psychology than fundamentals. When sentiment is extremely negative, it doesn’t take good news to trigger upside. It just takes news that’s “less bad than feared.” Analysts remain broadly constructive on Coinbase longer term, but risks remain: \\- Heavy dependence on crypto trading cycles \\- Regulatory uncertainty \\- Softer transaction revenue guidance \\- Ongoing volatility in digital assets Management is pivoting toward diversification, subscription services, stablecoin infrastructure, onchain adoption, and broader exchange ambitions. Whether that strategy fully offsets trading cyclicality will depend largely on the next crypto cycle. For short-term traders, volatility is opportunity. For long-term investors, the real question is whether crypto adoption and liquidity recover sustainably over the next few years. Right now, Coinbase isn’t signaling a confirmed turnaround. But it may be signaling something equally important: panic may have peaked. And in cyclical markets, especially crypto-linked equities, that shift in sentiment is often where trends quietly begin.", "text": "Relief rally or real recovery? riding coinbase’s volatility through stock futures COIN just reminded the market how emotional earnings season can be.

With Bitcoin starting 2026 in bear territory, pressure on trading-based platforms was inevitable. But here’s where it gets interesting. Adjusted for crypto-related losses, Coinbase still generated positive earnings. Subscription and services revenue grew, showing that the company is slowly diversifying beyond pure spot trading. That matters. It suggests the business isn’t standing still during the downturn. So why did the stock rally so aggressively on weak headline numbers? Because markets price expectations, not just results. Going into earnings, COIN had already fallen heavily year-to-date. A lot of fear was already baked into the price. When reality arrived and it wasn’t catastrophic, investors stepped in. That’s classic relief-rally behavior. Personally, I’ve been catching this move through stock futures on Bitget. That’s one advantage of having access to tokenized or futures exposure to U.S. equities within a crypto-native platform, you can react to volatility without switching ecosystems. Instead of watching the bounce from the sidelines, I positioned around the earnings volatility and rode the momentum. Not blindly, but with clear risk management, because these moves can reverse just as fast. From a broader perspective, this rally says more about market psychology than fundamentals. When sentiment is extremely negative, it doesn’t take good news to trigger upside. It just takes news that’s “less bad than feared.” Analysts remain broadly constructive on Coinbase longer term, but risks remain: \\- Heavy dependence on crypto trading cycles \\- Regulatory uncertainty \\- Softer transaction revenue guidance \\- Ongoing volatility in digital assets Management is pivoting toward diversification, subscription services, stablecoin infrastructure, onchain adoption, and broader exchange ambitions. Whether that strategy fully offsets trading cyclicality will depend largely on the next crypto cycle. For short-term traders, volatility is opportunity. For long-term investors, the real question is whether crypto adoption and liquidity recover sustainably over the next few years. Right now, Coinbase isn’t signaling a confirmed turnaround. But it may be signaling something equally important: panic may have peaked. And in cyclical markets, especially crypto-linked equities, that shift in sentiment is often where trends quietly begin.", "score": 0, "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1r45yys/relief_rally_or_real_recovery_riding_coinbases/", "post_url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1r45yys/relief_rally_or_real_recovery_riding_coinbases/"}

Bitcoin was once widely labeled “digital gold,” yet over time it has carved out a far more complex identity, sometimes moving with risk assets like equities, other times breaking away entirely. As we move through early 2026, with inflation concerns, geopolitical tension, and tech-driven narratives still shaping markets, understanding how these assets interact isn’t just interesting, it’s practical. I’ve learned that ignoring these correlations can lead to unpleasant surprises when volatility hits. A Brief Look Back: How We Got Here Gold has long been the classic safe haven. It doesn’t yield income, but it tends to hold value when confidence in financial systems weakens. Historically, its correlation with stocks has been low, making it a reliable diversifier during market stress. Bitcoin entered the scene in 2009 with a similar narrative: protection against fiat debasement. In its early years, that comparison made sense. But over the past decade, Bitcoin’s behavior has evolved in ways many investors, including myself didn’t fully expect at first. From 2021 to 2026, both Bitcoin and gold delivered strong long-term returns, but the paths they took were very different. In recent years, especially during periods of macro stress, gold surged while Bitcoin struggled. That divergence has been one of the clearest signals that Bitcoin is no longer trading like a traditional safe haven. Bitcoin and Gold: Drifting Further Apart In 2025 and into 2026, gold benefited heavily from inflation fears, central bank accumulation, and global uncertainty. Bitcoin, meanwhile, moved lower during several of those same periods. What stands out most today is the negative correlation between Bitcoin and gold. When markets turn defensive, capital tends to flow into gold first. Bitcoin, despite its capped supply, often gets sold alongside other risk assets. I’ve personally noticed that during risk-off moments, Bitcoin behaves less like protection and more like exposure. The Bitcoin-to-gold ratio tells the same story. It has fallen sharply from previous highs, reinforcing the idea that gold currently dominates as the market’s preferred hedge in uncertain conditions. Bitcoin and Stocks: A Much Tighter Relationship Where Bitcoin has grown closer is with equities, especially technology stocks. Over the past few years, its correlation with major stock indices has increased significantly. In 2026, Bitcoin often trades like a high-beta tech asset, it rallies harder in bull markets and falls faster during sell-offs. This has changed how I personally view Bitcoin. I no longer expect it to protect my portfolio during equity drawdowns. Instead, I treat it as a growth asset, one that thrives when liquidity is strong and risk appetite is high. This stock-like behavior also explains Bitcoin’s sharp volatility. When tech stocks sneeze, Bitcoin often catches a cold. Why These Correlations Exist A big reason for this shift is institutional adoption. Bitcoin is now widely traded by funds, ETFs, and corporate players who manage it alongside equities. In times of stress, these participants often sell Bitcoin quickly to raise liquidity, something they’re far less likely to do with gold. Gold still benefits from decades of trust. Central banks, insurers, and long-term allocators see it as a monetary hedge. Bitcoin, while scarce, is still viewed as a newer and more volatile asset, closer to innovation than preservation. I’ve seen this play out repeatedly: when fear spikes, Bitcoin gets sold first, gold gets bought first. Portfolio Implications: It’s Not Either-Or The key takeaway isn’t that one asset is “better” than the other, it’s that they serve different roles. Gold acts as a defensive anchor. Bitcoin acts as a growth accelerator. In my own portfolio thinking, Bitcoin and gold can coexist, but only if you’re clear about why you hold each one. Bitcoin adds upside potential and exposure to long-term technological adoption. Gold adds stability when things break. Blending small allocations of both has historically improved returns while reducing drawdowns compared to traditional portfolios. But timing and balance matter, especially in risk-off environments where gold has consistently outperformed. Looking Ahead: A Narrative Still in Motion Bitcoin’s story isn’t finished. If adoption continues to expand and volatility eventually compresses, it may regain some characteristics of a store of value. But in 2026, the reality is clear: Bitcoin trades more like a growth asset tied to stocks, while gold remains the market’s defensive backbone. For investors, the lesson is simple but important. Diversification isn’t about picking sides, it’s about understanding how assets behave together. Markets move in cycles, and each asset plays a different role in that rhythm.

February 5th was one of those days. Here's my attempt at a big-picture explanation about how we got there, and why there's still a bull case for the asset class + tech. Feedback appreciated! **Backing up** Expectations for crypto going into 2025 were sky-high. BTC started hitting new highs as soon as it was clear that Trump was going to win at the end of 2024. We were going from a Biden admin that was actively trying to kill the industry in the US, to a Trump admin that vowed to make America, \"the crypto capital of the world.\" Clear regulations were coming, Bitcoin had a fresh institutional narrative, and ETFs were ready to make it easy for big money to get exposure. **Record scratch** The world's biggest economy was finally embracing the technology we all spent 16 years building. Vibes were high. Then came perhaps the dumbest thing I've ever seen in my 8 years in crypto. The President of the United States of America - Donald J. Trump - launched his own shitcoin. Then his wife launched one too. The conversation shifted overnight from \"crypto will modernize financial markets\" to \"the president is running a pump and dump.\" A bunch of retail investors rushed into $TRUMP. Most got burned. And just like that, the people who've always hated this industry had a new reason to call the whole thing a scam. **Staying positive** Crypto has shrugged off embarrassment before, and there was still plenty to be positive about. Billions were flowing into the Blackrock Bitcoin ETF. Stripe, Visa, and even 100-year old companies like MoneyGram were going all-in on stablecoins. The Trump admin made good on passing federal stablecoin regulation, with the market structure bill (Clarity) that would set clear rules for the entire industry right behind it. It was still game on. **10/10** Most market participants (myself included) were looking for the year to close out at all-time highs.

I've been around crypto markets for 8 years, and every now and again, you have a day where everything is on fire. February 5th was one of those days. Here's my attempt at a big-picture explanation about how we got there, and why there's still a bull case for the asset class + tech. Feedback appreciated! **Backing up** Expectations for crypto going into 2025 were sky-high. BTC started hitting new highs as soon as it was clear that Trump was going to win at the end of 2024. We were going from a Biden admin that was actively trying to kill the industry in the US, to a Trump admin that vowed to make America, \"the crypto capital of the world.\" Clear regulations were coming, Bitcoin had a fresh institutional narrative, and ETFs were ready to make it easy for big money to get exposure. **Record scratch** The world's biggest economy was finally embracing the technology we all spent 16 years building. Vibes were high. Then came perhaps the dumbest thing I've ever seen in my 8 years in crypto. The President of the United States of America - Donald J. Trump - launched his own shitcoin. Then his wife launched one too. The conversation shifted overnight from \"crypto will modernize financial markets\" to \"the president is running a pump and dump.\" A bunch of retail investors rushed into $TRUMP. Most got burned. And just like that, the people who've always hated this industry had a new reason to call the whole thing a scam. **Staying positive** Crypto has shrugged off embarrassment before, and there was still plenty to be positive about. Billions were flowing into the Blackrock Bitcoin ETF. Stripe, Visa, and even 100-year old companies like MoneyGram were going all-in on stablecoins. The Trump admin made good on passing federal stablecoin regulation, with the market structure bill (Clarity) that would set clear rules for the entire industry right behind it. It was still game on. **10/10** Most market participants (myself included) were looking for the year to close out at all-time highs. The Fed was cutting rates, Bitcoin was revisiting its $125K ATH, and pundits were calling for $250K BTC, and $12K ETH alongside fresh highs for stocks and gold.

Silver downgrade kills pricing power. Bear case + puts thesisPandora (CPH:PNDORA) going plated is brand destruction. Silver downgrade kills pricing power. Bear case + puts thesis", "selftext": "Pandora’s recent decision to pivot away from sterling silver and toward platinum-plated jewellery (over their proprietary “Ever-shine” base alloy) is being framed as a smart response to the surge in silver prices. In reality, I think it is one of the worst strategic decisions I have seen from a mass-market luxury-adjacent consumer brand in years. This is not margin optimisation. This is Pandora fundamentally misunderstanding what business it is in, massively overestimating its brand power, and walking directly into a smaller, uglier, structurally inferior market. If I was a shareholder, I would actively campaign against this decision. **1) This decision screams CEO misread (wrong playbook, wrong industry)** Pandora’s new CEO, **Berta de Pablos-Barbier**, has a background that makes this decision make perfect sense to her, while being disastrous for Pandora: * President and CEO of LVMH’s champagne brands (Moët & Chandon, Dom Pérignon, Mercier) * CMO of Lacoste * Senior roles at Boucheron This is a person trained in the world of brand-first luxury, where the product itself is secondary to image, story, and logo. That logic works for champagne (where brand is the product), fashion houses (where the logo is the asset), and high jewellery (where heritage and design allow huge premiums over metal value). Pandora is not in those categories. Pandora is mass-market entry-level luxury jewellery. Their customers are not paying for a 200-year history. They are paying for an accessible version of real jewellery. The problem is that this decision reflects an executive worldview shaped by industries where you can detach the product from the underlying materials and still charge premium prices. Pandora cannot do that. Pandora is not a fashion brand that happens to sell jewellery. Pandora is a jewellery company with a brand premium. And that distinction is everything. **2) Pandora is a jewellery company first, and a brand second** People keep discussing Pandora as if it is a fashion-style brand business where the logo is the product and the underlying materials are irrelevant. It is not. Pandora is, first and foremost, a jewellery company. The brand matters, but it is an overlay on top of the product, not a substitute for it. Pandora’s pricing power exists because customers believe they are buying: * real jewellery (sterling silver) * branded jewellery (so it has trust and resale value) * sentimental jewellery (giftable, symbolic, personal) Pandora is not competing purely on design, scarcity, or craftsmanship. They are competing on the idea that you can buy something real, durable, and valuable without paying Tiffany prices. That is why Pandora can charge significantly more than Chinese and Indian OEM jewellery and unbranded charm products. Their customers might not understand metal markets, but they absolutely understand the difference between: * sterling silver * plated alloy Even if they cannot articulate it, they feel it instinctively. **3) Sterling silver gives Pandora a resale floor that plating destroys** Sterling silver is currently around **$2.40 per gram**. That means Pandora jewellery has something costume jewellery does not. It has an embedded commodity floor value. Even if the jewellery is scratched, damaged, or destroyed, the owner can still scrap it. That matters psychologically even if most customers never actually do it. And beyond melt value, Pandora pieces often resell above scrap because the brand adds a premium. This is why Pandora works so well as a gift product. It feels like a real asset. Now compare that to plated alloy. Platinum plating sounds luxurious, but in reality the amount of platinum used is microscopic. It is essentially dusting the surface. Even if Pandora’s Ever-shine alloy is decent, the scrap value of the metal content in a small charm is basically nothing. You are not going to take a plated charm to a jeweller and get meaningful money for it. If sterling silver is roughly $2.40 per gram, the metal value of a plated charm is closer to something like **$0.01 to $0.06 per gram**, depending on the alloy, plating thickness, and composition. Pandora’s alloy is proprietary so we cannot know exactly, but the point is obvious. From the customer’s perspective, the intrinsic value of plated alloy jewellery is effectively **zero**. So Pandora is destroying the “worst case” floor that has supported its pricing power for decades. Pandora’s management seems to think customers will not notice because the jewellery still looks shiny and premium. They will notice. Because the next step is predictable. The deeper issue is what this decision signals to the market. If Pandora has to strip out sterling silver to protect margins, it is effectively admitting that their historical profitability depended on selling precious metal at a premium. In other words, their pricing power may have been weaker than investors assumed. A company with true brand-led pricing power would pass higher input costs through to consumers. A company forced to downgrade materials is signalling that it cannot. **4) Pandora is making the worst possible product for plating: daily-wear jewellery** Plated jewellery can work in costume jewellery because most costume jewellery is worn occasionally. It is statement pieces worn to events, nights out, or parties, often larger necklaces, cuffs, and bangles. Those items do not see heavy daily wear. Pandora’s core products are the exact opposite: * charm bracelets * rings * stackable pieces * things people wear every day I personally know multiple people who wear their Pandora charm bracelet daily without taking it off. Daily wear is brutal. Constant friction, sweat, soap, perfume exposure, banging against surfaces, repeated abrasion on bracelet links and charm holes. Plating will wear off. Once it wears off, you get tarnish, discolouration, skin staining, and turning green complaints. And it does not matter how much Pandora insists their alloy is premium or proprietary. All it takes is one widely-shared meme: **Pandora turns green now.** And the brand is permanently damaged. Pandora is voluntarily walking into a predictable consumer backlash cycle that has destroyed countless mid-market jewellery brands. **5) This move forces Pandora into costume jewellery whether they admit it or not** If you remove sterling silver as the core material, Pandora becomes costume jewellery. This is not an opinion. It is literally a category shift. They can call it innovation or sustainability or new materials, but the consumer translation is simple: **Pandora is plated jewellery now.** And that is the exact positioning Pandora spent decades avoiding. Pandora’s customers did not choose Pandora because they wanted fashion accessories. They chose Pandora because it felt like the cheapest way to buy real jewellery with status attached. That is what is being destroyed. **6) The costume jewellery market is smaller, uglier, and structurally terrible** People do not understand how important market structure is here. The global costume jewellery market is valued around **$31 to $45 billion (2023 to 2024).** Now compare that to fine jewellery: * broader global jewellery market is estimated **$350 to $380 billion in 2025** * projected to exceed **$500 billion by 2033** * luxury jewellery segment specifically is **$49 to $66 billion (2024)**, with strong growth driven by Asia-Pacific demand So Pandora is pivoting away from a category adjacent to a hundreds-of-billions global market, and pushing itself into a far smaller, more commoditised, brutally competitive market. This is not a smart pivot. This is moving into a segment with worse economics. Costume jewellery is dominated by two kinds of players. First, fashion houses like Dior, Gucci, Chanel, and so on. They derive pricing power from clothing prestige. The jewellery is just an extension of the logo. Pandora does not have that type of prestige. Second, low-cost fast fashion and OEM supply chains. This is where the real competition is. Chinese and Indian manufacturers producing plated jewellery at absurdly low cost. Once Pandora becomes plated jewellery, it is forced into competition with an industrial machine that will undercut it forever. That is a race to the bottom. **7) History already shows what happens: the mid-tier costume giants collapsed** The best evidence that this market is terrible is that the old dominant names in costume jewellery are either dead or irrelevant. The mid-century American giants include Coro, Trifari, Monet, and Napier. These brands were huge. They had scale, recognition, and distribution. And the market still wiped them out. Some exist as trademarks, but the industrial powerhouses are gone. This is what happens when you sell non-precious jewellery at a premium without the fashion-house prestige moat. Pandora is voluntarily placing itself on the same path. **8) Swarovski exists, but Swarovski’s success proves the opposite of what Pandora thinks** If Pandora wants to play in premium costume jewellery, the obvious comparable is Swarovski. And to be clear, Swarovski is not collapsing. Their jewellery business is actually performing well. Swarovski’s Crystal Business generated **€1.906 billion in revenue in FY2024**, with 6 percent organic growth, jewellery sales growing 9 percent organically, lab-grown diamond sales more than doubling, and the company returning to profitability. So the lesson is not that Swarovski is failing. The lesson is why Swarovski is succeeding. Swarovski’s pricing power comes from something Pandora does not have. A genuine product identity. Swarovski is not generic costume jewellery. Swarovski is crystals. It has a materials story, a visual signature, and an instantly recognisable aesthetic that competitors cannot replicate without being obvious copies. Pandora has no equivalent. And Swarovski’s strategy is built around bold, colourful, extravagant statement design. Their LUXignite strategy positions Swarovski as “pop luxury” built on visual spectacle, plus a credible move into lab-grown diamonds. Pandora cannot replicate that. Pandora’s brand identity is fundamentally understated and sentimental. Its hero products are charm bracelets and stackable everyday pieces. If Swarovski’s identity is spectacle, Pandora’s identity is safe, wearable, and personal. So when Pandora shifts away from sterling silver into plated alloy, it does not read as reinvention. It reads as cost cutting. It reads as downgrade. That is the key difference. Swarovski’s customer experiences an upgrade in design and identity. Pandora’s customer experiences a reduction in material value. And in jewellery, that distinction is fatal. **9) The other comps do not work: Alexis Bittar and Kenneth Jay Lane are not Pandora** Other premium costume jewellery brands include Alexis Bittar and Kenneth Jay Lane. But these brands are design-led and niche. They are aimed at an older, more fashion-forward demographic and built around statement aesthetics. Pandora is the opposite. Mass-market, sentimental gift-driven, everyday wear, repetitive charm concept. Pandora cannot reposition into that design niche without losing its existing customer base. So Pandora is entering a market where it does not have fashion-house prestige, it does not have Swarovski’s crystal identity, and it does not have design-cult uniqueness. Which means it has no moat. **10) Once Pandora’s perceived quality collapses, pricing power is gone forever** Pandora’s current positioning is a very delicate sweet spot. It is above cheap high street jewellery, below fine luxury houses, real enough to justify the spend, accessible enough to be mass-market. That is why Pandora works. But if consumers start associating Pandora with tarnish, plating wear, green skin, and cheap alloy, Pandora loses its premium perception. Once that happens, the market forces Pandora down. They will be forced to cut prices to compete with Thomas Sabo, Lovisa, cheap Amazon brands, Shein-tier jewellery, and Chinese and Indian OEM supply. At that point, Pandora becomes a commodity retailer with a fading logo. And it will never regain its old pricing power. Brand perception moves down quickly and moves up extremely slowly. **11) Competitors will eat them once the brand is weakened** If Pandora loses its sterling silver anchor, competitors will take their market share. There are already strong alternatives: * Thomas Sabo * Lovisa * Trollbeads * Chamilia (owned by Swarovski, which is telling) * general fashion jewellery substitutes Pandora is basically handing them a free opportunity. Especially Chamilia, which already competes in the charm segment with Swarovski backing and costume jewellery expertise. **12) Moving down-market also blocks moving up-market** Once Pandora damages its brand perception, it traps itself. If it tries to go down-market, it faces OEM competition. If it tries to go up-market later, it faces Trollbeads (higher quality, rarer, less mass-market), Tiffany and Co, David Yurman, and real fine jewellery brands. Pandora copied Trollbeads’ entire concept originally, but Trollbeads has scarcity and craftsmanship Pandora cannot replicate at scale. Pandora has no easy upward path once it abandons its real metal identity. **13) Collabs are at risk: Disney is not guaranteed forever** Pandora has relied heavily on collaborations. Disney (major), Bridgerton (recent), and other branded tie-ins. If Pandora’s perceived quality collapses, those partner brands may reassess whether they want their IP associated with cheap plated jewellery. Disney already sells down-market costume jewellery. Pandora was attractive because it was above that tier. If Pandora becomes indistinguishable from lower market costume products, Disney can demand better terms, reduce partnership intensity, or walk entirely. Losing Disney would be catastrophic because Disney products are a meaningful share of Pandora’s demand engine. **14) The core problem: Pandora cannot detach itself from materials like true luxury can** In high jewellery, brands can charge massive premiums over metal value because they have centuries of heritage, design leadership, cultural prestige, craftsmanship narratives, and scarcity. Pandora has none of those moats. Pandora’s moat is scale, distribution, and real metal at accessible prices. If Pandora removes the real metal component, they are betting that their logo alone can support premium pricing. That is a luxury fashion assumption. And it is wrong. Even in luxury jewellery and fashion, materials still matter. Construction quality still matters. People still care about what they are actually buying. In high jewellery, materials matter even more than brand in the vast majority of cases. A Cartier necklace still needs to be gold. A Van Cleef piece still needs to be constructed properly. A Boucheron client still cares about stone quality. Pandora seems to be forgetting that jewellery is not champagne. Jewellery is not a t-shirt. Jewellery is not perfume. You cannot strip out the material value and expect the brand to survive unchanged. **Conclusion: This is not margin management, it is a value-destructive decision** Pandora switching from sterling silver to platinum-plated alloy is like a premium denim brand switching from real denim to polyester to protect margins. The spreadsheet looks better short term. The brand is structurally impaired long term. Pandora is not moving into a new innovative category. They are voluntarily stepping down into costume jewellery, a market that is smaller ($31 to $45B), brutally commoditised, structurally dominated by fashion houses and OEM mass production, and historically a graveyard for mid-tier premium brands. And they are doing it with the worst possible product format (daily-wear charm bracelets and rings), guaranteeing that plating failure becomes a consumer meme. Once the meme exists, Pandora’s pricing power collapses. Once pricing power collapses, Pandora is forced down-market. Once Pandora is down-market, it is fighting Shein and OEM factories. And that is not a business model. That is slow liquidation disguised as strategy. If shareholders are rational, they should fight this decision aggressively before Pandora permanently destroys the one thing that made the company valuable. Its position as the world’s default real jewellery for normal people. This is irreversible brand damage. **TL;DR:** Pandora switching from sterling silver to platinum-plated alloy is not a harmless cost-saving move. It is a structural downgrade that destroys the material value floor and “real jewellery” perception that underpins their pricing power. Because Pandora is daily-wear jewellery (bracelets, rings), plating wear and tarnish complaints will explode, damaging brand equity and forcing them down-market into a commoditised costume jewellery segment where they will be crushed by OEM imports and cheaper competitors. Swarovski works because it has a distinct crystal identity and reinvention narrative. Pandora’s move reads as cost-cutting and downgrade, not reinvention. If I were a shareholder, I would actively campaign against this decision. **(P.S. Sorry for the long post.)**", "text": "Pandora (CPH:PNDORA) going plated is brand destruction.

The mid-century American giants include Coro, Trifari, Monet, and Napier. These brands were huge. They had scale, recognition, and distribution. And the market still wiped them out. Some exist as trademarks, but the industrial powerhouses are gone. This is what happens when you sell non-precious jewellery at a premium without the fashion-house prestige moat. Pandora is voluntarily placing itself on the same path. **8) Swarovski exists, but Swarovski’s success proves the opposite of what Pandora thinks** If Pandora wants to play in premium costume jewellery, the obvious comparable is Swarovski. And to be clear, Swarovski is not collapsing. Their jewellery business is actually performing well. Swarovski’s Crystal Business generated **€1.906 billion in revenue in FY2024**, with 6 percent organic growth, jewellery sales growing 9 percent organically, lab-grown diamond sales more than doubling, and the company returning to profitability. So the lesson is not that Swarovski is failing. The lesson is why Swarovski is succeeding. Swarovski’s pricing power comes from something Pandora does not have. A genuine product identity. Swarovski is not generic costume jewellery. Swarovski is crystals. It has a materials story, a visual signature, and an instantly recognisable aesthetic that competitors cannot replicate without being obvious copies. Pandora has no equivalent. And Swarovski’s strategy is built around bold, colourful, extravagant statement design. Their LUXignite strategy positions Swarovski as “pop luxury” built on visual spectacle, plus a credible move into lab-grown diamonds. Pandora cannot replicate that. Pandora’s brand identity is fundamentally understated and sentimental. Its hero products are charm bracelets and stackable everyday pieces. If Swarovski’s identity is spectacle, Pandora’s identity is safe, wearable, and personal. So when Pandora shifts away from sterling silver into plated alloy, it does not read as reinvention. It reads as cost cutting. It reads as downgrade. That is the key difference. Swarovski’s customer experiences an upgrade in design and identity. Pandora’s customer experiences a reduction in material value. And in jewellery, that distinction is fatal. **9) The other comps do not work: Alexis Bittar and Kenneth Jay Lane are not Pandora** Other premium costume jewellery brands include Alexis Bittar and Kenneth Jay Lane. But these brands are design-led and niche. They are aimed at an older, more fashion-forward demographic and built around statement aesthetics. Pandora is the opposite. Mass-market, sentimental gift-driven, everyday wear, repetitive charm concept. Pandora cannot reposition into that design niche without losing its existing customer base. So Pandora is entering a market where it does not have fashion-house prestige, it does not have Swarovski’s crystal identity, and it does not have design-cult uniqueness. Which means it has no moat. **10) Once Pandora’s perceived quality collapses, pricing power is gone forever** Pandora’s current positioning is a very delicate sweet spot. It is above cheap high street jewellery, below fine luxury houses, real enough to justify the spend, accessible enough to be mass-market. That is why Pandora works. But if consumers start associating Pandora with tarnish, plating wear, green skin, and cheap alloy, Pandora loses its premium perception. Once that happens, the market forces Pandora down. They will be forced to cut prices to compete with Thomas Sabo, Lovisa, cheap Amazon brands, Shein-tier jewellery, and Chinese and Indian OEM supply. At that point, Pandora becomes a commodity retailer with a fading logo. And it will never regain its old pricing power. Brand perception moves down quickly and moves up extremely slowly. **11) Competitors will eat them once the brand is weakened** If Pandora loses its sterling silver anchor, competitors will take their market share. There are already strong alternatives: * Thomas Sabo * Lovisa * Trollbeads * Chamilia (owned by Swarovski, which is telling) * general fashion jewellery substitutes Pandora is basically handing them a free opportunity. Especially Chamilia, which already competes in the charm segment with Swarovski backing and costume jewellery expertise. **12) Moving down-market also blocks moving up-market** Once Pandora damages its brand perception, it traps itself. If it tries to go down-market, it faces OEM competition. If it tries to go up-market later, it faces Trollbeads (higher quality, rarer, less mass-market), Tiffany and Co, David Yurman, and real fine jewellery brands. Pandora copied Trollbeads’ entire concept originally, but Trollbeads has scarcity and craftsmanship Pandora cannot replicate at scale. Pandora has no easy upward path once it abandons its real metal identity. **13) Collabs are at risk: Disney is not guaranteed forever** Pandora has relied heavily on collaborations. Disney (major), Bridgerton (recent), and other branded tie-ins. If Pandora’s perceived quality collapses, those partner brands may reassess whether they want their IP associated with cheap plated jewellery. Disney already sells down-market costume jewellery. Pandora was attractive because it was above that tier. If Pandora becomes indistinguishable from lower market costume products, Disney can demand better terms, reduce partnership intensity, or walk entirely. Losing Disney would be catastrophic because Disney products are a meaningful share of Pandora’s demand engine. **14) The core problem: Pandora cannot detach itself from materials like true luxury can** In high jewellery, brands can charge massive premiums over metal value because they have centuries of heritage, design leadership, cultural prestige, craftsmanship narratives, and scarcity. Pandora has none of those moats. Pandora’s moat is scale, distribution, and real metal at accessible prices. If Pandora removes the real metal component, they are betting that their logo alone can support premium pricing. That is a luxury fashion assumption. And it is wrong. Even in luxury jewellery and fashion, materials still matter. Construction quality still matters. People still care about what they are actually buying. In high jewellery, materials matter even more than brand in the vast majority of cases. A Cartier necklace still needs to be gold. A Van Cleef piece still needs to be constructed properly. A Boucheron client still cares about stone quality. Pandora seems to be forgetting that jewellery is not champagne. Jewellery is not a t-shirt. Jewellery is not perfume. You cannot strip out the material value and expect the brand to survive unchanged. **Conclusion: This is not margin management, it is a value-destructive decision** Pandora switching from sterling silver to platinum-plated alloy is like a premium denim brand switching from real denim to polyester to protect margins. The spreadsheet looks better short term. The brand is structurally impaired long term. Pandora is not moving into a new innovative category. They are voluntarily stepping down into costume jewellery, a market that is smaller ($31 to $45B), brutally commoditised, structurally dominated by fashion houses and OEM mass production, and historically a graveyard for mid-tier premium brands. And they are doing it with the worst possible product format (daily-wear charm bracelets and rings), guaranteeing that plating failure becomes a consumer meme. Once the meme exists, Pandora’s pricing power collapses. Once pricing power collapses, Pandora is forced down-market. Once Pandora is down-market, it is fighting Shein and OEM factories. And that is not a business model. That is slow liquidation disguised as strategy. If shareholders are rational, they should fight this decision aggressively before Pandora permanently destroys the one thing that made the company valuable. Its position as the world’s default real jewellery for normal people. This is irreversible brand damage. **TL;DR:** Pandora switching from sterling silver to platinum-plated alloy is not a harmless cost-saving move. It is a structural downgrade that destroys the material value floor and “real jewellery” perception that underpins their pricing power. Because Pandora is daily-wear jewellery (bracelets, rings), plating wear and tarnish complaints will explode, damaging brand equity and forcing them down-market into a commoditised costume jewellery segment where they will be crushed by OEM imports and cheaper competitors. Swarovski works because it has a distinct crystal identity and reinvention narrative. Pandora’s move reads as cost-cutting and downgrade, not reinvention. If I were a shareholder, I would actively campaign against this decision. **(P.S.

Netflix lost 970,000 subscribers in Q2 2022 and the stock fell 51% for the year. They cut emerging market prices up to 50%, launched a $6.99 ad tier, cracked down on password sharing. Added 7.6 million subscribers in Q4 2022 alone. From the trough the stock went +344% through late 2024. Mylan had raised EpiPen prices from $103 to $608 over seven years. A 488% increase. When Congress hauled CEO Heather Bresch in she went on CNBC and said \"no one's more frustrated than me.\" They launched a half-price generic at $300. Stock fell 29% that year. It never recovered to 2016 levels. Mylan eventually merged with Pfizer's off-patent unit to form Viatris and the brand was gone. Gilead is the closest comparison to Novo. Sovaldi and Harvoni were blockbuster hepatitis C drugs — $19 billion in peak revenue. Then AbbVie launched a cheaper competitor, Express Scripts dropped Harvoni from its formulary, Congress investigated the pricing.

Either this is a structural bottom, or I just crowned myself the ultimate CRSR bagholder. I've gone back and forth on posting this for the last month because if I am wrong, this will be a very public and very expensive lesson. There has been very little talk about this stock anymore even after the recent earnings report, which tells me sentiment is crushed, but I have been dying to know whether I am missing something or seeing something others are not. So I bought \\~35k worth of CRSR in 2021 and it has been a painful and very consistent memory ever since. I know many here have encountered the same grind, but I assume not many would have leaned in as hard as I did. Apparently five years of losses was not enough for me, so over the last month, I convinced myself to buy another 500k worth which represents almost everything I have that is tangible. Until earnings lined up with what I suspected, I was straight up unwell for weeks. The day after I bought a sizeable amount, it ticked up about fifteen cents and I briefly thought I was a genius. Fifteen minutes later it rolled over and I was back to watching the same five year bloodbath. I even cut coffee for a few days thinking maybe the anxiety was self inflicted. It was not the caffeine. For context, I am the CEO of Eluktronics. We build enthusiast grade gaming laptops. We are not direct competitors with Corsair in most categories, but we have shared some suppliers, live through the same component cycles, and cater to the same performance focused market. I handle allocation, build of materials pricing, and supplier negotiations daily and have for fifteen years. I have lived through multiple memory cycles and this one is not normal. The reason I made what is easily the scariest purchase of my life started with a missed opportunity in Micron. I did not buy before earnings, despite aggressively securing their product for our own business the last few months while watching the prices rise, and that mistake forced me to step back and reassess what is happening in memory and storage. As many know, the PC industry ran into a perfect storm. OpenAI locked up major DRAM supply for 2026 with SK Hynix and Samsung, Micron exited the consumer segment, and panic followed for OEMs, system integrators, distributors, retail and businesses. Before the AI surge, we could buy 32GB SODIMMs as low as $75 each. Now we're lucky to find quality memory for less than $315 each. High-end 2TB SSDs we were sourcing for \\~$120 are now several multiples of that. I still cannot reconcile how quickly those numbers escalated and they are not stabilizing. What caught my attention even more than pricing was supply behavior. In fifteen years I have never seen module assemblers go nearly bone dry. I can almost always get a quote even if it is painful. This time I had most vendors tell me they literally had nothing to sell and one sales rep admitted he was probably going to lose his job. Retail has always lagged disti pricing because inventory and deals are often planned months in advance. In many instances, especially this time around, I was buying components for significantly less than we could even buy from direct vendors or distributors so I started buying as much as I could from retail that made sense. After seeing Micron and Sandisk earnings, it became obvious that whoever still had supply in this environment was benefiting. That is what led me to dig deeper again into Corsair. They were one of the only module vendors that still had product available across Amazon, Best Buy, Micro Center, B&H, Newegg & distribution. Meanwhile Team Group, Silicon Power, Adata, Mushkin and others were selling out and some have yet to restock. I initially assumed that as a global supplier Corsair might be diverting inventory into the U.S. to maintain presence here. That turned out not to be the case. I also monitored Amazon's transparent sales indicators like the “500+ bought in the last month” tags. Most of their product was not sitting idle. It was still moving while prices were climbing mountains. Crucial is stepping out of this segment as Micron pulls back from the consumer side. We will see this play out more in Q2 since they announced February as their planned end, but I have already seen multiple SKU discontinued notices on retail sites like B&H. That removes the most meaningful branded competitor from the retail channel, since Samsung and SK Hynix do not sell memory to retail. With supply for consumers about to get even worse and one of the most recognized names leaving, someone else is going to win out. On a prior CRSR earnings call, management mentioned they had secured DRAM ahead of the spike. At the time, I wondered just how much that meant. Seeing them consistently in stock while others were running dry suggests that comment and judgement call on their end was monumental. All of this leads to my core thesis. This memory cycle looks structurally different than anything I have seen in fifteen years, Corsair appears to have secured supply ahead of competitors and may have stronger supplier relationships. On the most recent earnings call they even reiterated they have invested in additional DRAM supply. Insider buying also caught my attention. Since the IPO, meaningful insider buying has been non-existent unless I'm missing something in the SEC EDGAR. That changed for the first time with Thi La buying 50k shares at $6.10 and long term board member (Sam S.) bought 100k shares at $6.59. I've seen comments saying those amounts are small relative to their compensation, but who would finally put their own money into something they believe is headed off a cliff? I have read the bear cases and many of them are valid. Post pandemic normalization is real and demand was clearly pulled forward. Customer service issues were not imaginary and Steve’s video deserved some popcorn to enjoy the show. Where I disagree is with the idea that RAM is just RAM and that memory is purely a commodity where anyone simply slaps their name on the product. That is simply not true. There are different grades of memory, real binning complexity, frequency ceilings, latency tolerances, and validation differences. Yes, the fabs manufacture the wafers, but consistently pushing higher frequency, tighter timing modules at scale is not trivial. From our own binning experience, SK Hynix tends to offer the strongest overclocking headroom, Samsung typically follows, and Micron generally trails when pushed beyond stated specifications. Based on that, I believe Corsair relies more heavily on SK Hynix for its higher performance kits. If Micron continues exiting the consumer segment, the impact on Corsair may be limited compared to many module suppliers that depend more heavily on Micron’s lower grade SpecTek chips, which are generally wafers that do not qualify for Micron branding. Yes, the chart has been terrible for quite some time. Sentiment is weak, and I have already been wrong for years holding this. Truthfully, my first purchase was a spur of the moment driven decision, hoping to catch a ride. This time was different. It came after a significant amount of research and a deeper look at the fundamentals that led me to lean in again. After the earnings report, I had a clear opportunity to finally turn a five year loss into a profit on this ticker, and I did not sell. I held, and I plan to continue holding, because I see much more upside here than I believe the market is recognizing. There is also the tariff situation. They absorbed about 12 million dollars. The IEEPA tariffs were ruled on Friday to be illegal by the Supreme Court, though whether refunds materialize remains uncertain. If it does result in a refund, that would be a giant offset to debt that's not being considered. The final piece of my thinking was demand behavior. When a 2TB SSD is priced at $700+, most consumers cannot and should not justify that purchase like a business would. Discretionary spending does not disappear, it reallocates. If core components feel irrationally expensive, gamers will pivot toward other upgrades instead, whether that is a new case, keyboard, headset, mouse, or other peripherals. No, peripherals would not replace memory revenue dollar for dollar, but if elevated component pricing persists, revenue mix can shift in meaningful ways. Corsair has reported margins near 40% on those categories. I am not presenting this as a clean turnaround story. The setup has been messy and skepticism exists for a reason. I could absolutely be wrong again. But sitting inside the same component ecosystem, this memory environment feels distorted in a way I have not experienced before, and Corsair appears to have positioned itself better than most other competitors. In my opinion, their brand value is underestimated and the current price does not reflect that. They finally have enough optimism in their own company to buy stock back, and are actually heading toward profitability. That is why I added and held instead of taking the escape hatch when it finally appeared. Curious to hear what I am missing, or whether this becomes the very public and very expensive lesson I debated posting all along. https://preview.redd.it/sh6oyn91r6lg1.png?width=1642&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a8df1867f414750e40bfebedb5907813b294238", "text": "I just went all in on CRSR after 5 years of pain **TLDR:** I 15x’d my CRSR position.

Before the AI surge, we could buy 32GB SODIMMs as low as $75 each. Now we're lucky to find quality memory for less than $315 each. High-end 2TB SSDs we were sourcing for \\~$120 are now several multiples of that. I still cannot reconcile how quickly those numbers escalated and they are not stabilizing. What caught my attention even more than pricing was supply behavior. In fifteen years I have never seen module assemblers go nearly bone dry. I can almost always get a quote even if it is painful. This time I had most vendors tell me they literally had nothing to sell and one sales rep admitted he was probably going to lose his job. Retail has always lagged disti pricing because inventory and deals are often planned months in advance. In many instances, especially this time around, I was buying components for significantly less than we could even buy from direct vendors or distributors so I started buying as much as I could from retail that made sense. After seeing Micron and Sandisk earnings, it became obvious that whoever still had supply in this environment was benefiting. That is what led me to dig deeper again into Corsair. They were one of the only module vendors that still had product available across Amazon, Best Buy, Micro Center, B&H, Newegg & distribution. Meanwhile Team Group, Silicon Power, Adata, Mushkin and others were selling out and some have yet to restock. I initially assumed that as a global supplier Corsair might be diverting inventory into the U.S. to maintain presence here. That turned out not to be the case. I also monitored Amazon's transparent sales indicators like the “500+ bought in the last month” tags. Most of their product was not sitting idle. It was still moving while prices were climbing mountains. Crucial is stepping out of this segment as Micron pulls back from the consumer side. We will see this play out more in Q2 since they announced February as their planned end, but I have already seen multiple SKU discontinued notices on retail sites like B&H. That removes the most meaningful branded competitor from the retail channel, since Samsung and SK Hynix do not sell memory to retail. With supply for consumers about to get even worse and one of the most recognized names leaving, someone else is going to win out. On a prior CRSR earnings call, management mentioned they had secured DRAM ahead of the spike. At the time, I wondered just how much that meant. Seeing them consistently in stock while others were running dry suggests that comment and judgement call on their end was monumental. All of this leads to my core thesis. This memory cycle looks structurally different than anything I have seen in fifteen years, Corsair appears to have secured supply ahead of competitors and may have stronger supplier relationships. On the most recent earnings call they even reiterated they have invested in additional DRAM supply. Insider buying also caught my attention. Since the IPO, meaningful insider buying has been non-existent unless I'm missing something in the SEC EDGAR. That changed for the first time with Thi La buying 50k shares at $6.10 and long term board member (Sam S.) bought 100k shares at $6.59. I've seen comments saying those amounts are small relative to their compensation, but who would finally put their own money into something they believe is headed off a cliff? I have read the bear cases and many of them are valid. Post pandemic normalization is real and demand was clearly pulled forward. Customer service issues were not imaginary and Steve’s video deserved some popcorn to enjoy the show. Where I disagree is with the idea that RAM is just RAM and that memory is purely a commodity where anyone simply slaps their name on the product. That is simply not true. There are different grades of memory, real binning complexity, frequency ceilings, latency tolerances, and validation differences. Yes, the fabs manufacture the wafers, but consistently pushing higher frequency, tighter timing modules at scale is not trivial. From our own binning experience, SK Hynix tends to offer the strongest overclocking headroom, Samsung typically follows, and Micron generally trails when pushed beyond stated specifications. Based on that, I believe Corsair relies more heavily on SK Hynix for its higher performance kits. If Micron continues exiting the consumer segment, the impact on Corsair may be limited compared to many module suppliers that depend more heavily on Micron’s lower grade SpecTek chips, which are generally wafers that do not qualify for Micron branding. Yes, the chart has been terrible for quite some time. Sentiment is weak, and I have already been wrong for years holding this. Truthfully, my first purchase was a spur of the moment driven decision, hoping to catch a ride. This time was different. It came after a significant amount of research and a deeper look at the fundamentals that led me to lean in again. After the earnings report, I had a clear opportunity to finally turn a five year loss into a profit on this ticker, and I did not sell. I held, and I plan to continue holding, because I see much more upside here than I believe the market is recognizing. There is also the tariff situation. They absorbed about 12 million dollars. The IEEPA tariffs were ruled on Friday to be illegal by the Supreme Court, though whether refunds materialize remains uncertain. If it does result in a refund, that would be a giant offset to debt that's not being considered. The final piece of my thinking was demand behavior. When a 2TB SSD is priced at $700+, most consumers cannot and should not justify that purchase like a business would. Discretionary spending does not disappear, it reallocates. If core components feel irrationally expensive, gamers will pivot toward other upgrades instead, whether that is a new case, keyboard, headset, mouse, or other peripherals. No, peripherals would not replace memory revenue dollar for dollar, but if elevated component pricing persists, revenue mix can shift in meaningful ways. Corsair has reported margins near 40% on those categories. I am not presenting this as a clean turnaround story. The setup has been messy and skepticism exists for a reason. I could absolutely be wrong again. But sitting inside the same component ecosystem, this memory environment feels distorted in a way I have not experienced before, and Corsair appears to have positioned itself better than most other competitors. In my opinion, their brand value is underestimated and the current price does not reflect that. They finally have enough optimism in their own company to buy stock back, and are actually heading toward profitability. That is why I added and held instead of taking the escape hatch when it finally appeared. Curious to hear what I am missing, or whether this becomes the very public and very expensive lesson I debated posting all along. https://preview.redd.it/sh6oyn91r6lg1.png?width=1642&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a8df1867f414750e40bfebedb5907813b294238", "score": 152, "num_comments": 134, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1rc8zot/i_just_went_all_in_on_crsr_after_5_years_of_pain/", "post_url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1rc8zot/i_just_went_all_in_on_crsr_after_5_years_of_pain/"}

This will be the quarter that $NVDA actually surges when the company reports outstanding earnings because it isn’t fully priced in right now. If the stock rallies ahead of the report in anticipation and my calls are green, I will convert the position into as many free spreads as possible while maintaining positive delta. I will not be buying or selling shares. # Why it isn't Priced In: Analyst consensus for Q1 FY27 Revenue Guidance still anticipates a slowdown in revenue growth. Every source I can find puts guided revenue in the $70- $71B range, while I am expecting closer to $76 billion, signaling continued AI demand strength. I wrote a DD far too long for this subreddit that explains why I see such a divergence, but the gist is that analysts have been estimating Q1 FY27 as the beginning of normalized growth for $NVDA for multiple quarters and will have to revise forecasts after the release. [Q1 FY27 Revenue and FY27 Revenue Estimates Show Slowing Growth](https://preview.redd.it/r53fbl8x2yjg1.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=b74fd9cee693b0aadd0ba72e0c9049516c48febe) While these forecasts have been slightly upgraded following the surprise CapEx from hyperscalers, **QoQ growth is expected to drop from \\~15% this quarter ($65.58 vs $57.01) to 8% in Q1 ($70.8 vs $65.58). Long-term growth forecasts are set to meaningfully change after $NVDA reports that the demand has not subsided** ***yet.*** # How to Actually Make Money From This: The stock currently trades for $182.81 at the time of writing, near the middle of the established trading range. While I do believe everything I said about revised forecasts serving as a bullish catalyst, it still makes sense to be buying at the bottom of the range ($170-$175) and selling at the top ($190-$195). No one will be surprised when $NVDA reports great earnings and solid guidance, but the lower half of the range is still pricing in negativity surrounding China, supply constraints, increased competition, and limited ROI on AI spend. Tomorrow, I plan to buy additional $185 calls. In the remaining 6 trading sessions from then until earnings, I will add onto the position if the stock hits the lower end of the trading range, and will turn my calls into debit spreads if $NVDA is going into earnings at the top of the range. This way, I go into the print either with cheap calls at a strike the stock can absolutely hit on solid earnings, or I have ITM debit spreads that would earn max gain unless the stock drops to the lower half of the range after earnings.

This will be the quarter that $NVDA actually surges when the company reports outstanding earnings because it isn’t fully priced in right now. If the stock rallies ahead of the report in anticipation and my calls are green, I will convert the position into as many free spreads as possible while maintaining positive delta. I will not be buying or selling shares. # Why it isn't Priced In: Analyst consensus for Q1 FY27 Revenue Guidance still anticipates a slowdown in revenue growth. Every source I can find puts guided revenue in the $70- $71B range, while I am expecting closer to $76 billion, signaling continued AI demand strength. I wrote a DD far too long for this subreddit that explains why I see such a divergence, but the gist is that analysts have been estimating Q1 FY27 as the beginning of normalized growth for $NVDA for multiple quarters and will have to revise forecasts after the release. [Q1 FY27 Revenue and FY27 Revenue Estimates Show Slowing Growth](https://preview.redd.it/r53fbl8x2yjg1.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=b74fd9cee693b0aadd0ba72e0c9049516c48febe) While these forecasts have been slightly upgraded following the surprise CapEx from hyperscalers, **QoQ growth is expected to drop from \\~15% this quarter ($65.58 vs $57.01) to 8% in Q1 ($70.8 vs $65.58). Long-term growth forecasts are set to meaningfully change after $NVDA reports that the demand has not subsided** ***yet.*** # How to Actually Make Money From This: The stock currently trades for $182.81 at the time of writing, near the middle of the established trading range. While I do believe everything I said about revised forecasts serving as a bullish catalyst, it still makes sense to be buying at the bottom of the range ($170-$175) and selling at the top ($190-$195). No one will be surprised when $NVDA reports great earnings and solid guidance, but the lower half of the range is still pricing in negativity surrounding China, supply constraints, increased competition, and limited ROI on AI spend. Tomorrow, I plan to buy additional $185 calls.

We don’t even need to compare NVDA to AMD, take a look at NVDA vs good old WMT. WMT is a boomer, defensive staple with single-digit growth, yet it commands a forward multiple of roughly 44x.

A lot has happened in the last couple months so I thought I was worth to write another DD update. **T+0 Collateral (Digital Title)** The biggest and most exciting update was success of two of their digital title pilots with the other still pending, Currently industry values it at $0 so Abaxx is valued on the success of their exchange which on its own is worth tens of billions in my opinion as mentioned in my prior report. I believe digital title tech though is really what will drive Abaxx’s value. Cantor Fitzgerald sees it as a strong catalyst for the stock later this year when Abaxx can release their monetization framework since they were successful in the pilots but they maintain a price target of $81 CAD (+85% from here) for now. [Cantor's Thoughts on Digital Title](https://preview.redd.it/ehvjv2ij2hjg1.png?width=758&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8c1fba53f106ad77c228165ec37ca14b1359c35) **Money Market Funds Pilot Recap** Abaxx was able to instantly create a transaction of a bilateral gold swap using $200k of BMO MMF funds held in a third party custodian as collateral while maintaining legally enforceable title. Normally this process would take a couple days. Because the title transfer can happen instantly, the original holder can keep it in place and still collect yield on the product. They are also in a better position to get less of a haircut on it because it moves much quicker. It basically increases the velocity of collateral in the financial system. Abaxx is claiming their process can generate 1.5% to 2.75% in annual value creation across the $8 trillion worth of US MMF funds that exists in the world. Assuming they can get it into the hands of financial institutions. It's unclear how much they can charge but if you use 10 basis points (0.1%) as an example that would be $8 billion in annual revenue at the upper limit in just MMF funds. Which makes me point back to what Cantor said about the success of the pilots and how it will be a strong catalyst once they release their market strategy. It is important to keep in mind they are the first to be able to launch this and have been working on it the past 5 years. The unique selling point with them is they are backed by their globally licensed clearinghouse and exchange which they built from the ground up. So they have a strong go to market strategy. Financial institutions connecting to their exchange for futures products would inevitably also be able to access these products as a cross selling product. **Gold Pilot Recap** It doesn’t just stop at MMF funds though. Their tech expands to even gold stored in a warehouses via a custodian. Their pilot with Ivanhoe Capital and Kilo Capital showed this. Using Abaxx Digital Title, Ivanhoe Capital was able to pledge their gold easily to get financing with Kilo Capital with gold stored at Abaxx Spot. Abaxx Spot held the gold and handled the instant settlement process via their Digital Title tech. Ultimately what this does, is it unlocks all the gold stored in warehouses to be used much more efficiently as collateral as they can be margin called instantly compared to the typical multi day settlement process with industry standard methods. Abaxx is also taking this one step further though with their Minehub pilot to unlock commodities in transit as collateral as well. So if a LNG tanker takes 30 days to cross the ocean, owners could pledge that cargo instantly as collateral for futures trades on their exchange as long as its managed and tracked via Minehub. The TAM for this would be the entire commodities supply chain ranging from oil, LNG, gold, to even copper which is valued at \\~$135 trillion. I believe the value creation here is significant. Advance rates for LNG cargos is around 25-30% based on some rough research. What this means is if an LNG cargo is worth $45 million, they can often only extract maybe $13.5 million in terms of loan value. If Abaxx with their digital title and Minehub can help them extract $30 million or more, you would see around 50% in value creation across that use case. Scaled up, you could maybe see trillions unlocked in terms of collateral. How much Abaxx can charge for these efficiencies is still not know yet, but whatever the number, the revenue potential is insane. **Exchange Volumes** On to the exchange volumes they are seeing a steady increase in exchange volumes across the contracts which [you can track here](https://abxxtracker.streamlit.app/) along with the estimated revenue daily. Keep in mind, US customer onboarding lags so while they got access to the US market back in November via the FBOT, we are still yet to see the real network effects as more traders get access to the platform. Liquidity continues to grow, with impressive quarter over quarter growth. Their physically settled LNG contracts are well on the way to benchmark status which would be worth billions on their own. Silver should be coming soon along with rare earths with hints at the first physically delivered uranium contract. The CEO has indicated their upcoming silver contract is expected to be even more popular than their gold contracts with many participants onboarding specifically for it. The Corsia Carbon Contract has also seen a surge in activity and is becoming more active making Abaxx the benchmark for carbon futures contract as it is the only one with liquidity. [Abaxx Exchange Volumes](https://preview.redd.it/hzy8zy773hjg1.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&s=1640953ed484437c239f1493b464a353a6629087) The volume and revenue generated may still be still small but it's important to realize these things scale exponentially. As volume grows, it draws more volume in. A liquid LNG contract would suck up all the JKM LNG trading volume for example. A liquid gold and silver contract would suck up hedging volumes and maybe even replace the New York Futures and London Spot system currently setup as Abaxx will have a futures and spot market with same size deliveries in the same jurisdiction at the source of the main demand in Asia. This effect will be even greater once we start seeing US firms using the contracts. To give you an example you can look at the NYMEX ClearPort as it scaled exponentially over the years in terms of volume. The chart here by [James](https://x.com/James_Duade) highlights this growth with the first years of volume rather low but then grew more than 10x the following year. If Abaxx is able to replicate this growth, they could be breakeven next year already based on the exchange only. Joe Raia who was behind the Clearport launch is currently in charge of Abaxx's contract launches so the team is stacked with industry veterans who have done this before. [Clearport Contract Growth](https://preview.redd.it/bpn4xqci3hjg1.png?width=2342&format=png&auto=webp&s=6056631359347dca6084c57242c4ff4e1984f930) **Other Updates** Abaxx has received their FBOT from the CFTC back in November which grants them direct access to the US market. This was the final step in making them a globally recognized clearinghouse and exchange and work directly with customers around the world. They have also been gaining steam on onboarding US customers. Just last week they announced access via TMX’s Trayport which will give 9800 industry traders access to their physically delivered contracts by end of next month. They have also launched a couple wind futures contracts while also expanding the currencies they support on the exchange as collateral. **Catalysts Ahead** Abaxx is going to market with their digital title program with the backing of their licensed clearinghouse and exchange this summer. Maybe even sooner. This will likely drive significant interest to them. Uplisting to major exchanges appears also to be in the works as well. So it's possible we see a that in the near future. The uplist will also bring along with it multiple index inclusions. For those who like to look at charts instead to guide your investing decisions, it seems like there is a strong base at this level that has held steady for the past 3 months. https://preview.redd.it/ck07nd9o3hjg1.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=613fab2c22805891435a263d76ff99b4debbd6a4 Happy to answer any questions.

They are also in a better position to get less of a haircut on it because it moves much quicker. It basically increases the velocity of collateral in the financial system. Abaxx is claiming their process can generate 1.5% to 2.75% in annual value creation across the $8 trillion worth of US MMF funds that exists in the world. Assuming they can get it into the hands of financial institutions. It's unclear how much they can charge but if you use 10 basis points (0.1%) as an example that would be $8 billion in annual revenue at the upper limit in just MMF funds. Which makes me point back to what Cantor said about the success of the pilots and how it will be a strong catalyst once they release their market strategy. It is important to keep in mind they are the first to be able to launch this and have been working on it the past 5 years. The unique selling point with them is they are backed by their globally licensed clearinghouse and exchange which they built from the ground up. So they have a strong go to market strategy. Financial institutions connecting to their exchange for futures products would inevitably also be able to access these products as a cross selling product. **Gold Pilot Recap** It doesn’t just stop at MMF funds though. Their tech expands to even gold stored in a warehouses via a custodian. Their pilot with Ivanhoe Capital and Kilo Capital showed this. Using Abaxx Digital Title, Ivanhoe Capital was able to pledge their gold easily to get financing with Kilo Capital with gold stored at Abaxx Spot. Abaxx Spot held the gold and handled the instant settlement process via their Digital Title tech. Ultimately what this does, is it unlocks all the gold stored in warehouses to be used much more efficiently as collateral as they can be margin called instantly compared to the typical multi day settlement process with industry standard methods. Abaxx is also taking this one step further though with their Minehub pilot to unlock commodities in transit as collateral as well. So if a LNG tanker takes 30 days to cross the ocean, owners could pledge that cargo instantly as collateral for futures trades on their exchange as long as its managed and tracked via Minehub. The TAM for this would be the entire commodities supply chain ranging from oil, LNG, gold, to even copper which is valued at \\~$135 trillion. I believe the value creation here is significant. Advance rates for LNG cargos is around 25-30% based on some rough research. What this means is if an LNG cargo is worth $45 million, they can often only extract maybe $13.5 million in terms of loan value. If Abaxx with their digital title and Minehub can help them extract $30 million or more, you would see around 50% in value creation across that use case. Scaled up, you could maybe see trillions unlocked in terms of collateral. How much Abaxx can charge for these efficiencies is still not know yet, but whatever the number, the revenue potential is insane. **Exchange Volumes** On to the exchange volumes they are seeing a steady increase in exchange volumes across the contracts which [you can track here](https://abxxtracker.streamlit.app/) along with the estimated revenue daily. Keep in mind, US customer onboarding lags so while they got access to the US market back in November via the FBOT, we are still yet to see the real network effects as more traders get access to the platform. Liquidity continues to grow, with impressive quarter over quarter growth. Their physically settled LNG contracts are well on the way to benchmark status which would be worth billions on their own. Silver should be coming soon along with rare earths with hints at the first physically delivered uranium contract. The CEO has indicated their upcoming silver contract is expected to be even more popular than their gold contracts with many participants onboarding specifically for it. The Corsia Carbon Contract has also seen a surge in activity and is becoming more active making Abaxx the benchmark for carbon futures contract as it is the only one with liquidity. [Abaxx Exchange Volumes](https://preview.redd.it/hzy8zy773hjg1.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&s=1640953ed484437c239f1493b464a353a6629087) The volume and revenue generated may still be still small but it's important to realize these things scale exponentially. As volume grows, it draws more volume in. A liquid LNG contract would suck up all the JKM LNG trading volume for example. A liquid gold and silver contract would suck up hedging volumes and maybe even replace the New York Futures and London Spot system currently setup as Abaxx will have a futures and spot market with same size deliveries in the same jurisdiction at the source of the main demand in Asia. This effect will be even greater once we start seeing US firms using the contracts. To give you an example you can look at the NYMEX ClearPort as it scaled exponentially over the years in terms of volume. The chart here by [James](https://x.com/James_Duade) highlights this growth with the first years of volume rather low but then grew more than 10x the following year. If Abaxx is able to replicate this growth, they could be breakeven next year already based on the exchange only. Joe Raia who was behind the Clearport launch is currently in charge of Abaxx's contract launches so the team is stacked with industry veterans who have done this before. [Clearport Contract Growth](https://preview.redd.it/bpn4xqci3hjg1.png?width=2342&format=png&auto=webp&s=6056631359347dca6084c57242c4ff4e1984f930) **Other Updates** Abaxx has received their FBOT from the CFTC back in November which grants them direct access to the US market. This was the final step in making them a globally recognized clearinghouse and exchange and work directly with customers around the world. They have also been gaining steam on onboarding US customers. Just last week they announced access via TMX’s Trayport which will give 9800 industry traders access to their physically delivered contracts by end of next month. They have also launched a couple wind futures contracts while also expanding the currencies they support on the exchange as collateral. **Catalysts Ahead** Abaxx is going to market with their digital title program with the backing of their licensed clearinghouse and exchange this summer. Maybe even sooner. This will likely drive significant interest to them. Uplisting to major exchanges appears also to be in the works as well. So it's possible we see a that in the near future. The uplist will also bring along with it multiple index inclusions. For those who like to look at charts instead to guide your investing decisions, it seems like there is a strong base at this level that has held steady for the past 3 months. https://preview.redd.it/ck07nd9o3hjg1.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=613fab2c22805891435a263d76ff99b4debbd6a4 Happy to answer any questions.

For example, until very recently, only a handful of stock options were backed by market makers, liquidity sucked, and fills were hard to get. I've traded stocks, stock options, index options, and index futures. This post is about index options. The Nikkei 225 index has 3 sizes, full, mini, micro. Micro doesn't have options. Each point on these represents 1000 yen, 100, and 10, respectively. For easy math, assume 100 yen = 1 USD (though it is closer to 153 these days). Here I was trading mini index options. I opened up a calendar spread, selling a near term put against the next expiry put (weeklies on Wednesdays and Fridays). I held the short leg through expiry because I wanted to see how assignment worked. Obviously I knew it was financially settled, but I was curious. The first thing to notice was margin: there is no margin offered in Japanese accounts, so it tied up nearly 500000 yen ($5k) to open the short leg, NOT offset by my long leg. Trading ends the day before expiry. Then settlement is made against the Special Quotation at 9am the next day. So you've got to white knuckle it overnight. Even though SQ happened already, the option still showed in my IBKR positions the whole day and the value seemed to fluctuate (though in fact it had been fixed at 9am), messing up my daily PnL. After I got assigned on the short leg, I wanted to sell to close the long leg. At this point, the long leg was quite ITM, by 5 strikes or do. There was no quote on the options chain, even though it was the next expiry! I noticed quotes were present for 2 or 3 ITM strikes and a bunch of OTM strikes. I set a MARKET order to sell to close and it didn't fill, even after an hour. I ended up selling another put to create a vertical, as a way to synthetically close my position and lock in some profit. Note, however, that again there was no margin, so again I needed 500k yen to maintain the position. I ended up holding everything through assignment. I made 5000 yen from opening the positions and made another 4565 yen on assignment. Total profit: 9565 yen ($95 by that earlier assumption, but really like $60 at today's rate). Conclusion: this isn't very capital efficient due to no margin. The lack of quotes for ITM options is concerning, and especially the lack of a fill for a market order.

The first thing to notice was margin: there is no margin offered in Japanese accounts, so it tied up nearly 500000 yen ($5k) to open the short leg, NOT offset by my long leg. Trading ends the day before expiry. Then settlement is made against the Special Quotation at 9am the next day. So you've got to white knuckle it overnight. Even though SQ happened already, the option still showed in my IBKR positions the whole day and the value seemed to fluctuate (though in fact it had been fixed at 9am), messing up my daily PnL. After I got assigned on the short leg, I wanted to sell to close the long leg. At this point, the long leg was quite ITM, by 5 strikes or do. There was no quote on the options chain, even though it was the next expiry! I noticed quotes were present for 2 or 3 ITM strikes and a bunch of OTM strikes. I set a MARKET order to sell to close and it didn't fill, even after an hour. I ended up selling another put to create a vertical, as a way to synthetically close my position and lock in some profit. Note, however, that again there was no margin, so again I needed 500k yen to maintain the position. I ended up holding everything through assignment. I made 5000 yen from opening the positions and made another 4565 yen on assignment. Total profit: 9565 yen ($95 by that earlier assumption, but really like $60 at today's rate). Conclusion: this isn't very capital efficient due to no margin. The lack of quotes for ITM options is concerning, and especially the lack of a fill for a market order. I think I'll stick to index futures or options I want to hold through expiry.", "score": 52, "num_comments": 15, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1raia7a/my_experience_trading_mini_nikkei_index_options/", "post_url": "https://i.redd.it/hu7xs6z85skg1.jpeg"}

I still cannot believe how insane this move was, especially considering almost no other tech companies were affected. I think Microsoft is a strong buy at this price. The main worries following Q2 2026 earnings seem to be i) over-exposure to OpenAI ii) concerns over CAPEX iii) slowing Azure growth. Firstly, Microsoft are really not that exposed to OpenAI. Last quarter they reported $400bn RPO, average delivery time 2.5 years, without disclosing its makeup. This quarter they disclose $625bn, of which 45% is OpenAI, so $406.25 is non-OpenAI and grew at 28%. Literally nothing has changed. In fact they have less exposure to OpenAI than I originally thought. OpenAI paid Azure an estimated $11.6bn \\[1\\] in FY2025, not that much as a percentage of their \\~$168.9bn cloud revenue). Let's also subtract the $30bn Anthropic deal, for $\\~375bn RPO over the next 2.5 years. Microsoft's CAPEX 2026 forecast is £115bn forecast, so their spending is well covered just by the RPO. They are making 68% gross margins on cloud, and have heavy internal usage for GPUs (Copilot) so they don't need to write them off when the next hot model comes out, as pure-play cloud providers like Oracle do. Copilot is fully integrated into the Consumer Microsoft365 subscription, with growth in that segment jumping from \\~5% to 25%, since they raised subscriptions 50% (for the first time in 12 years, justified by Copilot). 15m paid Commercial copilot seats in the last few months out of possible Commercial 365 user base of 300m, and it sells for the same price as the full 365 subscription. Even 25% take-up would be a huge boost for that segment's revenue (FY2025: 87.77bn). Despite the hate Copilot gets, it is proving to be very useful for organizations \\[2\\] (why need to look up / figure out excel formula when you can just ask an inbuilt LLM do fill it in for you?). There is cloud compute demand from OpenAI and Anthropic, but this is simply the cherry on the cake. Why not let their OpenAi and Anthropic investors pay for Microsoft's data center buildout, which they can monetize through Copilot and other enterprise cloud users? Long-term there will be heavy, sustainable compute demand from business as they integrate LLM integration into their products and processes (e.g. many websites and software now have LLM integration in some form, and its growing). It seems like a large reason for the drop was Azure growth at 39% instead of 40%, and CAPEX $37.5bn instead of the forecast $34.3bn. CAPEX was over by $3.1bn, that's only 2.7% of the annual projection, it's insignificant in the grand scheme of things, and guided lower for Q3. Microsoft's datacenter build out has actually been very considered e.g. they took a pause in 2024 and let OpenAI use other providers for compute to reduce Microsoft's concentration risk (OpenAI were originally contractually obliged to use Azure) \\[3\\]. This build out is not wasted money, it's critical to develop the infrastructure now to capture enterprise who are integrating LLMs into their products, so MSFT can keep their long-term revenue from inference and not lose them to other cloud providers. Azure is due to overtake AWS as the largest cloud provider by 2027 and Google Cloud is a distant third. Also, their new Maia chip is pretty good and can be used with PyTorch, if this is rolled out successfully the impact on margins will be absolutely massive, reducing the need to purchase expensive NVIDIA GPUs. Also note, Microsoft own all OpenAI's model and chip IP until \\~2032 at least. The share price is also taking a hit because Microsoft is a 'software company', and people are worried about the impact of LLMs on software moats. People just generically quote this like it means something. Do they really think some tech bro's are going to vibe code an entire operating system and enterprise environment with Claude over a summer? It's just so out of touch with reality. For the most part, software companies are the ones who will benefit from LLMs through increased dev efficiency and improved product offering as they integrate LLMs in their tools. At the moment analysts want to see low CAPEX but 40%+ cloud growth (Azure growing way faster than AWS or Google Cloud, BTW). Microsoft are pretty unique in that they have with both a cloud division and very clear path to LLM monetization through their own product line, with continued double-digit 365 subscription revenue growth. The fact people are worrying about a rounding error on Azure growth is missing the wood for the trees. MSFT is trading around 27-29 PE for FY 2026, depending on where you look. The share price is where it was in May 2025, before a year of absolutely explosive double-digit growth. Its segments are still growing between 15-25% and but its multiple is close to the historic average of around 27. SPY is at 32 around 32 PE. I just think it's completely crazy that this has happened. A 2% drop, 5% at the very most I would think incorrect but at least somewhat understandable if the most bullish expectations were dropped, but (at points) 12%!?

This text is meant for beginners. Why am I writing this? Because writing down this process helps me improve and potentially connect with like-minded individuals. Anyone is welcome to comment, point out mistakes, and suggest improvements. I wrote this from experience, this is not a one size fits all text and IMO that's the beauty of options trading - you just HAVE to think with your head and be flexible. If I missed something - please let me know in comments but also keep in mind that something not mentioned here is going to be mentioned in the upcoming parts of this text since there's a 40 000 character limit on reddit. I wanted to start this one with watchlists. Enjoy. \\-------------------------- I see traders build large watchlists of like 120+ stocks that they then update monthly. If you ask me - the greatness is in simplicity and 120 is not simple, that's more like \"I don't wanna miss a good opportunity\". IMO, you are then as a trader spread out too thin, the \"focus of a trader\" or let's say their \"decision making quality\" becomes lower. What I do for example is that I have 4 different watchlists with max 20 stocks. (Max is 25 and lowest is 9 currently) Each of them serves a purpose: 1) Stocks of interest 2) Silent stocks 3) Current stocks 4) Stocks to buy options on What typically happens is - a stock comes to 1, then maybe gets moved to 3. Same as for 2, maybe gets moved into 3. The difference between 1 and 2 is that under 1 there are stocks that are known/trending ( read \"growth\"). Under 2 are the beaten down ones or just in general silent (love these) 4 is the last on the list for a reason, it requires maximum conviction for a certain investment and these rarely happen. Now, the same stock can be in multiple lists, for example 2 and 4. (Good for LEAPS) Why this approach? Less clutter, I as a trader can switch mentally easier on how I approach each investment. I found this approach useful to reduce overtrading and even chasing premiums. If somebody else uses a different approach I'd love to hear it but I hope you understand my approach. \"Cut relentlessly\". \\----------------------------------- Anyways, with a list of 120+ stocks, you can find 10+ opportunities that meet your criteria at any given moment for sure, but then you get into temptation quite easily. I don't want to get myself into that position so I use a trick: The last thing on my \"to-do list\" is to check full market (us equities, S&P 500, popular stocks, wheelers, sub-15 stocks). These 5 are premade in a tool I use but the point I want to get across is that \"whole market outlook\" needs to be last order of business. I don't waste much here - up to 2 minutes. For starters, a good research on stocks can be made by using some filters when searching on Stock Unlock (took a look, never fully used it). Or you can even write custom prompts in perplexity for example (Tried it - got actually very good results, just pick a good ai and double check the numbers). You can later use ai to teach you what certain numbers mean if you're starting out. The first site I mentioned considers metrics like P/E ratio, analyst target price etc.. This is useful if you're starting out but that's not how I started out personally. I checked an option screener and saw which stocks pop up with great deals down to average ones. Then researched every one of them online until I understood them. Yahoo finance was my best bud. I also used ai to break down everything. When you're done with this, it's practical to have 2-5 stocks when starting out in a watchlist. While screening bunch of stocks is time consuming, it's worth it because it dramatically increases your odds of doing that first step of the wheel right. My advice: Find some stocks that are inevitable to succeed. The biggest investment opportunities happen when: \\- The world NEEDS something (like copper for EVs) \\- There isn't enough of it (supply can't grow fast) \\- Everyone is scared (trade wars, recession fears) \\- The fear doesn't fix the problem (tariffs don't create copper) There's much more but I don't wanna get too much into it. Onto the actual options trading part.. \\---------------------------------- DTE Strategy when picking CSPs: Weekly approach (4-11 DTE let's say) I'll usually sell Monday and target Friday expiration (4 DTE same week) If I hit 80% profit on Monday or Tuesday: * Close the position immediately * Recycle the capital into either: * (a) a rolled CSP on the same Friday * (b) new wheel on the same Friday If you hit 80% profit on Wednesday or later: * Close and reassess * If rolling, move to the *following Friday* (not the current one—theta is too aggressive, risk isn't worth it) This is quite active and the downside is that you're paying more commissions due to frequent closing and rolling. You need a big account to make this make any sense in doing so. Why this is done? When you close a position at 80% profit, you're recycling capital faster rather than waiting for that last 20% of profit. Close at 80% *only if you've identified a better opportunity.* Otherwise, let theta work. Use a screener to make this decision real-time, not reactive. A screener proved to be useful for me here, you do this \"tactic\" mostly if you have a better use of the capital - most often in a different stock. But yeah, this again - makes sense only on bigger acc. Also, even if the general aim is to sell puts on the up trending stocks, that doesn't mean that the stock only needs to move up for you to enter a csp. Normalize selling a csp if the stock is falling and you actually want it at that level.!! Selling a csp in my opinion should be about taking someone elses risk and making money of of it. \\---------------------------------- Monthly approach (30-52 DTE) 45 DTE is the sweet spot here because you get \"most time for your money\". You get lower commissions and it's mentally easier aswell. My advice is just to check any upcoming news about that stock and even what's happening out there in the world. \\---------------------------------- My take: If you ask me what I think about all this - **I think it can be simpler.** If you got 80% of the profit before any expiration then check why. Also, check how much time there is left in that trade because of theta decay. If you got more % profit in the first few days of a trade than the average expected amount per day in a trade then you can also re-asses and start over. From that you should get enough information and proceed with your next decisions. Stay? Deploy capital elsewhere? Start a new wheel? You can't predict when the stock will start going up or down, you manage your positions according to what's happening. Want it even simpler? **Shorter DTE on speculative plays - lets you collect IV premium.** **Longer DTE on high-conviction plays - lets you average down and compound.** ***Just that, nothing more.*** Decide between two above and pick accordingly. So yeah, if you're starting out just don't follow the \"rules\" blindly. Be agile.. Consider a good stock pick, have a small watchlist, keep it simple, stay on \"low assignment side\", don't chase premiums. The rest, weekly vs. monthly, rolling vs. closing...becomes obvious when you've actually executed a few hundred trades. Thank you for your time and I hope this text helped someone. Sincerely, David", "text": "Wheel strategy guide (part 2/X) - watchlist advice and DTE Greetings, This is a text about the wheel options strategy and it's a second part to it that I've written. This text is meant for beginners. Why am I writing this? Because writing down this process helps me improve and potentially connect with like-minded individuals. Anyone is welcome to comment, point out mistakes, and suggest improvements. I wrote this from experience, this is not a one size fits all text and IMO that's the beauty of options trading - you just HAVE to think with your head and be flexible. If I missed something - please let me know in comments but also keep in mind that something not mentioned here is going to be mentioned in the upcoming parts of this text since there's a 40 000 character limit on reddit. I wanted to start this one with watchlists. Enjoy. \\-------------------------- I see traders build large watchlists of like 120+ stocks that they then update monthly. If you ask me - the greatness is in simplicity and 120 is not simple, that's more like \"I don't wanna miss a good opportunity\". IMO, you are then as a trader spread out too thin, the \"focus of a trader\" or let's say their \"decision making quality\" becomes lower. What I do for example is that I have 4 different watchlists with max 20 stocks. (Max is 25 and lowest is 9 currently) Each of them serves a purpose: 1) Stocks of interest 2) Silent stocks 3) Current stocks 4) Stocks to buy options on What typically happens is - a stock comes to 1, then maybe gets moved to 3. Same as for 2, maybe gets moved into 3. The difference between 1 and 2 is that under 1 there are stocks that are known/trending ( read \"growth\"). Under 2 are the beaten down ones or just in general silent (love these) 4 is the last on the list for a reason, it requires maximum conviction for a certain investment and these rarely happen. Now, the same stock can be in multiple lists, for example 2 and 4. (Good for LEAPS) Why this approach? Less clutter, I as a trader can switch mentally easier on how I approach each investment. I found this approach useful to reduce overtrading and even chasing premiums. If somebody else uses a different approach I'd love to hear it but I hope you understand my approach. \"Cut relentlessly\". \\----------------------------------- Anyways, with a list of 120+ stocks, you can find 10+ opportunities that meet your criteria at any given moment for sure, but then you get into temptation quite easily. I don't want to get myself into that position so I use a trick: The last thing on my \"to-do list\" is to check full market (us equities, S&P 500, popular stocks, wheelers, sub-15 stocks). These 5 are premade in a tool I use but the point I want to get across is that \"whole market outlook\" needs to be last order of business. I don't waste much here - up to 2 minutes. For starters, a good research on stocks can be made by using some filters when searching on Stock Unlock (took a look, never fully used it). Or you can even write custom prompts in perplexity for example (Tried it - got actually very good results, just pick a good ai and double check the numbers). You can later use ai to teach you what certain numbers mean if you're starting out. The first site I mentioned considers metrics like P/E ratio, analyst target price etc..
